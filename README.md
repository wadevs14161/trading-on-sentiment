## Overview

The Stock Sentiment Investment Project is an initiative to explore the relationship between public sentiment, particularly from platforms like Reddit (specifically the r/wallstreetbets community), and stock market movements. The goal is to develop tools and models that can:

* **Collect and analyze textual data** from social media and other sources related to specific stocks.
* **Quantify sentiment** expressed in this data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
* **Develop investing strategies** based on data collected and organised.
* **Calculate cumulative returns** to benchmark performance against established market indices.

This project is currently in an **ongoing** phase and aims to provide insights and tools for both researchers and individuals interested in the intersection of social media and finance.

## Key Features

* **Reddit Data Collection:** Scripts to scrape and store historical posts and comments from relevant subreddits.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Implementation of various NLP techniques (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, transformer-based models) to analyze the sentiment of textual data.
* **Data Storage:** Utilizes a robust database (currently MariaDB, with potential for other options) to store collected data, sentiment scores, and stock prices.


## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for data collection, analysis, and backend development.
* **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the web interface (optional).
* **NLP Libraries:** Libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face) for natural language processing.
* **Data Scraping:** Libraries like PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and potentially others for web scraping.
* **Database:** MariaDB (MySQL compatible) for storing project data.
* **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Data Visualization (Optional):** Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating charts and graphs.
* **Financial APIs:** Integration with APIs like Alpha Vantage or others to fetch stock data.
