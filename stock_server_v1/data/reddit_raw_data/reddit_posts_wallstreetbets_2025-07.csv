1me5xcy,A Carvana Bear Case,110,130,"Hi, I don't like Carvana, and think it is massively overvalued. They shot up to an all time high of $385 after their most recent earnings report, and I wanted to post my thesis on why Carvana is worth shorting. Before we get into it, I **am** biased against Carvana, I **do** have puts on Carvana, and those puts **are** losing money. It's cool, I'm not mad. I'm definitely not mad. This is partially for my own edification and research, but hopefully you find it useful as well!

If you would like a professional opinion first, then before reading what I have to say, you may want to check out is [this report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) on Carvana from Hindenburg. They had a similar short position and wrote their own bear case for Carvana. I think they made some salient points which have highlighted problems which have actually been getting WORSE since writing that report.

For me, I took a look at their[ most recent Earnings report](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&FilingId=18649181-55571-322427&CIK=0001690820&Index=11000), as well as their [previous earnings report in May](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/carvana/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=page&FilingId=18442840-44193-290080&CIK=0001690820&Index=11000).

https://preview.redd.it/w5zvkn56m8gf1.png?width=2023&format=png&auto=webp&s=803df496e15ff034862222302f584b01f297026d

Compared to last quarter, Carvana holds 520 million more in cars in inventory (the total value of all their cars). Their total assets have increased by 488 million. Which means they have reduced their assets by 32 million in the process of acquiring these cars. And to add my own interpretation, Carvana will buy cars often without regard to quality. There is a distinct possibility that a portion of these will sit unsold for the entirety of the company's existence. Nevertheless they count these cars as assets. According to Kelley blue book, ""On average,¬†*new cars depreciate about 30% over the first 2 years*, and continue to depreciate 8-12% each year after that."" So even in the generous interpretation that all of these cars are sellable assets, the cars they are sitting on are only getting less valuable over time.

https://preview.redd.it/xodu17wmm8gf1.png?width=2027&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c1c56bc12cb747d5213da4edf530c8c4eec508c

But are they selling all these additional cars? On a positive note, their gross profits are up by 135 million, however once operating expenses are considered, their net income was actually down by 67 million. Net income for this quarter was 308 million, down from 373 million last quarter. This is primarily due to a 117 million increase in operating expenses.

Their liabilities have increased by 144 million. Increasing in every category across the board. When we subtract their liabilities from their assets, Carvana's equity was 1.773 billion last quarter, and 2.117 billion this quarter, increasing by 344 million. Which is less than their increase in car value. You may interpret this as an investment in high quality inventory. Or, you may interpret this to mean that they are converting themselves into a rotting graveyard of used cars. Your choice.

Regarding loans, Carvana originates car loans and then sells them to partners. They do this through forward flow agreements and fixed pool loan sales. These are blind boxes of car loans and are essentially the auto industry version of a Mortgage Backed Security, which I'm sure you remember from the 2008 financial crisis. That is NOT to suggest Carvana is going to somehow cause a financial crisis, just to add context and highlight that these are some risky sub-prime loans. Last quarter they sold 800 million in fixed pool loan sales, this quarter they sold 1.2 billion. A 50% increase.

https://preview.redd.it/8lwn6scdm8gf1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc99f4e49c9ad8cd256c31c5f05dbc1151bdb73

You may have heard that over the course of this year, auto loan delinquencies are on the rise. LendingTree says 5.1% of Americans with Auto loans are delinquent as of this month. Carvana sells their loans, so is this relevant? Well, if Carvana's loans are a product they aim to sell, and that product is reducing in value, I think that could certainly reduce their sales. And that has been happening. Car loan company Ally has reduced their dealings with Carvana. And Carvana has been increasingly relying on these sales as a key element of their income, ""Almost 26% of Carvana‚Äôs gross profit consisted of sales of customer auto loans to third parties"" according to Hindenburg, and it's only gotten worse.

**The Grift**

If we can imagine a world where Carvana is worth $400, I think I can take a moment to imagine a world where they're bankrupt. Because they almost were, and may still be headed there, despite earnings reports. This part is more speculative, so feel free to ignore it, but the report I mentioned earlier from Hindenburg talks about Carvana's many issues which I highlighted above, and eludes to some unsavory business practices which may or may not be going on below the surface. And these are the kind of practices that wont increase your shareholder value, unfortunately.

A big one the report highlights is Carvana's relationship with DriveTime, a company owned by the founder's father. A large portion of Carvana's car sales are allegedly made to DriveTime, a used car company. The report also notes several instances when DriveTime's founder, the dad, has made a total of at least 5 billion from selling Carvana shares at the elevated price.

Hindenburg suggests, ""Carvana appears to be dumping unreported costs of extended warranties onto related-party DriveTime, resulting in artificially inflated revenue and profitability. We estimate Carvana reports \~58% more warranty income per sale due to the relationship.""

What could be happening here is that Carvana is offloading unsellable cars to DriveTime in exchange for dad's cut of Carvana. But at some time in the future DriveTime will declare bankruptcy and Carvana will be unable to continue inflating their numbers.

Is this believable? Well Hindenburg also states that the father and owner of DriveTime previously ""pled guilty to felony bank fraud over allegations that he helped a company report fake accounting income through sham transactions. SEC charges also alleged he ‚Äúsigned a falsified letter for \[the company‚Äôs\] auditors."" So this could literally just be the dad repeating his past grift after getting caught in his last venture. And shareholders may be the ones being grifted.

The other issue is with loan sales. Given Ally's reduced business, how has Carvana continued to offload their subprime auto loans? Maybe they haven't. According to Hindenburg, ""In the past two quarters, Carvana sold $800 million in loans to an ‚Äúunrelated third party.‚Äù The mystery buyer made up 18.3% and 16.3% of total loan sales in Q2 and Q3 2024""

I can't verify this, as it is shrouded in secrecy. The report implies that the loans are being sold to ""Cerberus Capital, where Carvana Director Dan Quayle is Chairman of Global Investments""

And on top of that, they also make the allegation that ""Carvana‚Äôs loans held on its books have increased 50% since 2021, to $553 million in Q3 2024. Carvana uses an accounting treatment that records no loss reserves on these loans at booking""

So they aren't actually able to offload all of these toxic assets, even to Cerberus Capital, and at some point, this will come tumbling down. It wont bring the stock market with it like in the 2008 financial crisis, but Carvana themselves would certainly go bankrupt. If you aren't going to sell, at LEAST set a stop loss.

**Valuation**

Leaving the very plausible bankruptcy question out of the equation, let's consider Price to earnings based SOLELY on what was actually reported. Carvana stock's biggest issue right now is its extremely distorted valuation.

To compare, let's look at a reasonable competitor, Carmax. Carmax sells used cars online. Carmax also sells car loans. It's also a dinosaur, one I would not personally look at or even think about if not for this post. But here goes.

|For Most Recent Quarter|Share Price|Earnings (EBIT)|Earnings Per Share|Price to Earnings (ttm)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$385|308 Million|$1.28|117.81|
|Carmax|$58|283 Million|$1.38|16.38|

As you can see, Carmax looks to be a better earner than Carvana. And no, I dont think Carmax is the one being incorrectly valued.

To be thorough, let's also compare their most recent Book values, which is equivalent to the total stockholder equity. Carvana's most recent book value is 2.1 billion, and Carmax's book value is 6.2 billion. Barchart's most recent Book value per share puts, Carvana at 8.3 per share, and Carmax at 41.89 per share.

But what SHOULD Carvana's value be? Well that depends on your valuation method. Let's go through them.

**""Carvana should be priced for growth""**

This is about as positive a take as you can get. This is assuming Carvana grows according to its own estimates, which is predicted by analysts and represents their view of the stock's growth. I am using a forward PE ratio for this calculation, which is equal to the current stock price divided by the estimated earnings for the future. Note that this is a 12 month calculation so the PE values will be slightly different than a ten trailing month PE.

|Earnings Per Share Projections|EPS|(Forward) PE|(Future) Stock Price With 25.90 PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EPS Real 2024|$1.59|242|$41.18|
|EPS Estimate 2025|$5.06|76|$131.05|
|EPS Estimate 2026|$6.23|61.79|$161.36|
|Nvidia Estimate 2025|$4.02|43.96|$104.12|

So as you can see, in this reality, Carvana is a much better growth stock than Nvidia, which is widely considered the most valuable stock in the world. Just kidding, of course. Even assuming this level of growth, Carvana has an extremely high premium attached to it.

The final column estimates what the valuation would be if Carvana was given the average PE of stocks in the S&P 500 right now (which is about 5.9 above historical averages, so pretty generous I think). As you can see, any stock price above $131 is pretty clearly pricing in returns from 2026, and even that suggests a **66% downside** from it's current level at $385.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Earnings""**

What if Carvana was valued based on its earnings per share at the same level that carmax is (16.38), based on the ten trailing months for both?

|Price To Earnings|EPS (ttm)|16.38 PE|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|2.85|(2.85 \* 16.83)|$46.68|
|Carmax|3.68|(3.68 \* 16.83)|$60.27|

So in this reality, Carvana is a stock trading BELOW Carmax at $50 a share, representing an **82% downside**.

**""Carvana should be equal to Carmax's Price to Book Value""**

What if Carvana was valued based on the same Price to book value that carmax is? The book value is used sometimes when evaluating a company based on its raw value. Car companies and banks sometimes trade for a value pretty close to their book value, as they are not often priced for growth.

|Price To Book Value|Book Value Per Share|1.44 Price To Book Value|Stock Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Carvana|$8.30|(8.3 \* 1.44)|$11.95|
|Carmax|$41.89|(41.89 \* 1.44)|$60.32|

In THIS reality, Carvana would ALSO be trading below Carmax at $12 a share, representing a **97% downside**. And on top of that, we have to consider that both of these businesses are considering their cars to be assets, when those cars may or may not actually be worth as much as reported. So to be REALLY negative, you could say 97% downside is charitable.

**Carvana should be equal to its price target**

In this reality, you never read this post and dont care about anything except what REAL stock analysts say. Okay. Well, fine. The street high price target is $450 per share, representing a **16.9% upside** over the next 12 months. The average is $352.17, representing an **8.5% downside**, and the lowest is $260 representing a **32.5% downside**. So all but the most bullish of analysts also agree that Carvana is actually ABOVE what its price should be in 12 months.

**Summary**

If you ask me, Carvana is overvalued. Possibly by an order of magnitude. Buy puts on it if you're a sicko like I am and want companies to be valued reasonably. A valuation sicko. And then I guess tell people about it, because unless people actually BELIEVE it's overvalued, it's going to stay overvalued until the truth comes out.

My advice to current shareholders is to take your profit and put it into a healthy business. Or if you aren't invested, consider long dated puts! If word is able to get out about this, maybe consider shorter dated puts, who knows?

**TL;DR**

Carvana scam stock, buy puts.

**The Agentic AI Era**

""A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.""

-Alan Watts

LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) at this point have essentially solved language. After advances in model training approaches and hardware, this was a lot easier to do than expected, largely due to the vast and varied amount of digitized written text on the internet. 

While these products are already revolutionizing certain professions, the industry and investors are already looking to the next thing. There‚Äôs a couple ideas on the horizon. One is superintelligence (aka, Meta), turbocharged LLMs that are smarter than humans. The other is agentic functioning, AI that is designed to do things. Here, superintelligence is not as critical, performance is tied to social functioning as they interface with systems designed for people. 

Agentic AI can mean a few things and to varying degrees of complexity. Nearest to basic LLM, quasi-machine friendly systems, an AI agent may call your doctor's office for you and schedule an appointment with your receptionist. In more advanced but still mostly text-based forms, an AI agent may manage your calendar, negotiate simple purchases, or coordinate services with other AIs on your behalf. The larger stride in agentic AI is past digital and text based medium, into handling decision making on your behalf in real world contexts- think interacting with household objects, interpreting social signals, threat detection and protection.  This is the area of humanoid robotics, currently receiving massive investments from Telsa, and an inevitable target for the rest of the big tech players. 

Like with LLMs- sounds hard until it's not. The technical breakthrough will hinge in sourcing and leveraging ideal datasets. Tesla is currently training their Optimus robots on data streams like YouTube videos, but in terms of acting and behaving like humans, there is a non-public, unparalleled training dataset available. This is a dataset that will make humanoid robotic devices that need to be socially aware, navigate the world in context of social cues, and build trust relationships with owners. To be clear, it a critical piece to an LLM-sized breakthrough, and perhaps greater, in agentic AI. 

And unlike superintelligence (the nerdy kid who has read about how to be cool in books), performant agentic AI will be more impactful than superintelligence in the same manner as Chad, who has failed up his whole life due to his social prowess. 

**The Slow Death of the Social Network**

Before we look more in depth at SNAP, let's check in on the ""social media"" landscape. A social network is a platform where people who know each other use technology to improve or enhance their peer-to-peer or community engagements. Here's why they largely do not exist anymore:
 
Facebook: Ad delivery system for youths with little / no natural actual real world social dynamics present. Maybe still something of a social network for boomers, but boomers Facebook experience is also fairly corrupted by AI / brainrot content that they can‚Äôt distinguish from reality.

Tiktok/instagram: endless scroll, optimized for large content creators, little to organic peer to peer social aspects, not for people who know each other to talk with each other. 

Reddit: terminally online autists exchange asynchronous messages largely around upvote farming and out-cringing each other. 

Snap: The only at-scale platform where people still communicate directly with people they actually know. Core experience still chat, video, voice, maps, streaks (read small, high-frequency, high-context exchanges). True to what social networks were originally envisioned as, it‚Äôs a high-resolution behavioral mirror of human life, especially among younger generations, and still dominated by exchanges between socially adept individuals who have non-online relationships.
 
**Commercializing the Social SNAPshot**

It is speculative, yet perhaps unavoidable, that the largely undiluted true social network of SNAP will be discovered/reframed as a undervalued training dataset / continuous data collection platform for humanoid robotics training data. 

SNAP's dataset is ideal for training large, transformer architecture which are natively tolerant of multimedia inputs. Life is a multimedia experience: spoken word, visual expressions and reactions, and written communications all blend and associated within the rich relationships captured within the platform. Tapping into these data streams, and the complex social graphs, allow training data to essentially capture not just the multimedia experience of being human, but even the cadence. A popular concept in Jazz is that brilliance lies in the rests between played notes: similarly, in true relationships, the timing between responses, and the media inputs which dictate the cadence of responses, is likely hugely influencing in teaching human like machines not just how, but when, to respond, which will have a huge bearing on social aptitude of these systems. Think of the feelings you would have towards a system that is programmed to reach out 24 hours after not hearing from you, versus one that knows to reach out at the right time to connect with you, comfort you, or even challenge you. Combine the rich multimedia experience and temporal component, multiply it across a web of remarkably lifelike social exchanges, and you arrive at something singular: the closest thing we have to a behavioral training ground for humanlike machines.

If we can accept the value of what SNAP is sitting on, let's discuss the moat. An important aspect of this dataset is that it is not publicly discoverable, which should help for monetization. Reddit‚Äôs stock price inflated massively when the market began to price in its value for AI training, however, Reddit‚Äôs training dataset is largely exposed to the internet making it easy to steal, which hampers pricing and put them a step behind in monetizing this. SNAP can control access, and therefore pricing, from an earlier stage, potentially making their dataset proportionally more valuable than companies where their training dataset is on display to the world like Reddit or LinkedIn. 

Could a larger player simply stand up a true social network to tap these human dynamics? My thesis is that they could not. Social media worked prior to our knowledge of what they were and what they would become. Given the slow bleed of true social behaviors on these platforms, and the immense value they have produced (extracted) from the social landscape, newcomers are met with skepticism and an almost repulsion from most people. SNAP has two important qualities that provide a huge amount of inertia and competitive advantage: it was early enough to establish credibility before the public grew wary of social platforms, and it's popular with youth - a group that‚Äôs still highly social, less curated in their expression, and embedded in environments like school where dense social graphs naturally form. 

The ship may have sailed to create another SNAP: what SNAP has in the last true social network, may not just be valuable, but foundational. SNAP is not likely the company to build the devices, nor would need to train the models, but with the right acquisition or partnerships, they can play the kingmaker in agentic AI training. 

**Who's going to tell SNAP? Risks to the thesis**

\- Delayed Agentic AI Era

* The necessary hardware for embodied AI and humanoid robotics may take longer to mature.
* If that happens, the window to monetize SNAP‚Äôs dataset may arrive too late for the company to benefit or even survive.
* However, SNAP still appears undervalued on fundamentals alone: revenue is growing, debt is declining, valuation remains at the low end of social media peers

\- SNAP Fails to Realize Its Own Value

Snap may never recognize the strategic importance of its dataset to agentic AI. If so, it risks:

* Shifting toward META-style algorithmic feed optimization, which could erode the organic human interaction that makes its data valuable (already, arguably, in progress)
* Overcommitting to hardware wearables, which may enrich data types but not outweigh the diversion in focus from platform-level AI opportunity
* Undervaluing its data in licensing or partnership deals due to lack of awareness

\- Execution Risk

* Successfully transitioning from a consumer social platform to a data infrastructure or licensing company requires different leadership, strategic vision, and monetization models.
* SNAP may not be equipped to make that leap on its own.

Even if SNAP can't figure it out on their own, the market will likely step in on its behalf. As the agentic AI revolution takes shape and hyperscalers hit walls trying to model social nuance, SNAP‚Äôs position as a uniquely rich behavioral dataset will become increasingly difficult to ignore. And of course, if SNAP figures this out, they can optimize their platform to maximize data retention, cohesion, and social modeling to best prepare for the agentic AI opportunity. 

**The play**

I am in for 25k in shares, and planning to keep adding to the position. I might consider an exit if the forward looking impression of SNAP changes to account for these ideas and generate a quick 10x, otherwise I let it ride as the agentic AI era takes off.

1mdgfvf,CoreWeave: The Future of Search and AI Infrastructure?,0,24,"CoreWeave is arguably the leading cloud company for AI workloads from a technical standpoint. They‚Äôre not just good‚Äîthey‚Äôre the best at what they do. Let‚Äôs put aside the $12B in debt for a moment and focus on something more interesting: they‚Äôve gone from $400M in revenue in 2024 to a projected $5B+ in 2025. That‚Äôs insane growth.

Now compare that to AWS‚ÄîAmazon‚Äôs cloud arm. Back in 2010, AWS did around $500M in revenue, and by 2014 they hit $5B. Fast forward to Q1 2025 and AWS is doing $30B in a single quarter.

1mdf1wf,DD on $SNAP‚Ä¶The Path to Breaking $11 in the Coming Weeks,47,67,"Hey everyone,
Alright, let's talk about a name that many have written off: Snap Inc. ($SNAP). I know it's been a volatile and often frustrating stock to own, but I've been watching the price action and the recent news closely, and I believe we're seeing the setup for a potential breakout above the $11 mark in the next few weeks.
Here's my bull thesis, broken down into a few key points.
1. The Technical Picture is Improving
From a technical analysis (TA) perspective, $SNAP is starting to look constructive.
 * Consolidation Base: The stock has been carving out a solid base in the $9.30-$9.40 range for a while now. This period of consolidation after a downtrend can often precede a move higher.
 * Psychological Barrier at $10: The $10 level is a huge psychological hurdle. We've seen the stock test it, get rejected, and then reclaim it. A sustained hold above $10 would be very bullish and could attract momentum traders.
 * Next Resistance: If we hold above $10, the next logical area of resistance on the chart is right around $11-$11.25. Given the right catalyst, a push to test this level seems highly probable.
2. The Amazon Catalyst is Under-appreciated
The partnership allowing users to buy products from Amazon directly through Snapchat ads is a game-changer, in my opinion.
 * Closing the Loop: This move directly addresses a major weakness for $SNAP: ad attribution and return on investment (ROI). It makes it much easier for advertisers to see a direct conversion from an ad view to a sale.
 * Higher Ad Value: As the ROI becomes clearer and more potent, Snap can command higher prices for its ad inventory. This is a direct tailwind for Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key metric. The formula for revenue is essentially DAU \times ARPU. While Daily Active Users (DAU) growth is modest, boosting ARPU is the fastest way to grow the top line.
3. Snapchat+ is a Silent Success Story
Snapchat's subscription service, Snapchat+, is quietly building a significant, high-margin revenue stream. They recently surpassed 5 million subscribers. While this isn't a massive number on its own, it proves two things:
 * A core group of users is willing to pay for enhanced features.
 * It diversifies revenue away from being 100% reliant on advertising, which is crucial in a tough macroeconomic environment.
4. Sentiment is Still Overwhelmingly Negative
Let's be honest, the market hates this stock. It's been beaten down for so long that any piece of good news is met with skepticism. This is exactly the kind of environment where a sentiment reversal can cause an aggressive rally. The stock is far from its all-time highs, and a short-term re-rating doesn't seem out of the question as the business fundamentals slowly improve.
Risks to Consider:
 * Competition: TikTok is a monster, and Meta's Reels are always a threat. Snap needs to continue innovating to keep its user base engaged.
 * Macro Headwinds: Ad spending is highly cyclical. If we enter a significant economic downturn, $SNAP's ad revenue will take a hit, regardless of their new features.
 * Execution: Management has to deliver. Any missteps on an earnings call or bad guidance could send the stock spiraling back down.
Conclusion / TL;DR:
The combination of a constructive technical chart, a powerful and under-hyped catalyst with the Amazon partnership, and growing high-margin subscription revenue makes a compelling case for $SNAP. With the stock building support above the key $10 level, I believe it has the momentum to test and break through $11 in the coming weeks.
Positions: Long 985 shares of $SNAP.

1md28w3,ELTP - What My Stock Analysis Looks Like - Plus Two Bonus Drops from Friday,24,26,"https://preview.redd.it/u5561mkzfzff1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=775209d3fd34729207bfc89c54bbb2a52bf399af

# Analysis

I took values for each drug, accounted for the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), ELTP's market penetration and worked out a revenue stream for each. Then I allotted value for other variables - time to complete a patentable technology (SequestOx), market shares increasing to the level that the sales department has reached for other drugs etc. to get a range of values. I tried to be conservative in my approach to give a range I feel will be seen in a buyout scenario or exceeded in a buyout scenario.

I've purchased and sold companies, I analyze properties and portfolios of real estate, I have provided valuations for syndications, and I've been hired as a consultant to provide an estimate of the future value of projects. This by NO means, makes me an expert, nor am I saying this means you need to rely on my advice. I am simply sharing my experience and giving you all some insight to how I got about these things. I'm sure we all do this to an extent, but, we are only able to use the tools we have seen others use sometimes, so hopefully this is valuable information for you.

So, based on above, I see it very reasonable to expect a buyout in the range of $2.67 to $4.57 per share or higher. That's a 5x to 9x opportunity. Now, let's say you hate me or my methodology. Fair enough. How wrong do you think I am? 10% - fair enough - that's a negotiating range. But a negotiating range goes down AND up. 20% off? Possibly. 30% off? 40% because you think I'm a level 10 regard?

Even if you cut this by 50% it's still a 2.45x to 4.5x value from today.

# Upcoming Catalysts

The Q1 earnings call is coming up around Aug 15th, and, if you recall, I made two guarantees last time I posted about ELTP. One, that it would be a record breaking annual revenue on the July year end earnings call - which I was correct on. Two, that this Q1 would be record breaking revs YOY. If I'm wrong on either, I will accept a ban from this board is what my guarantee was and I'm halfway there.

The last earnings call said that ELTP is almost to phase 2 of what they estimate to be a 3 phase strategy to sell the company. They said the investment bank would be chosen in the next three to four months, so it could be announced at any time.

You may or may not recall a post I did about ELTP's first time having a large investment fund purchasing shares a few months ago. That company was called Ancor Holdings, and here is a reminder of why that is a very intriguing detail. ELTP has NEVER had a large investment company (they have $10 billion under management) buy shares, to my knowledge, and I've researched this company for the last eight years. It was a TINY amount of shares, but my theory is that it was a legal maneuver. By disclosing that they had purchased shares, it removed any claim that there was any insider information that induced them to buy. If I'm right, it's a super smart play and allows them another 90 days to accumulate shares essentially under the radar if they are trying to amass a respectable position without driving the price up. Let's say they wanted to accumulate 5% of the company - the next reporting date for their total shares is August 15th as well, coincidentally. The number of TRADING days between their last report and August 15th?¬†**69 days**. Coincidence? I think not, good sirs.

Lastly, on Friday, the company had the first insider buy that I've seen in the last 8 years at least - maybe longer. Now, who do you want to see buy? Who knows info first? The CEO? CFO? Nope - the Chief Marketing Officer. Mr. Kirko Kirkov himself. Jesus holds the honor of turning water into wine, but Mr. Kirkov is turning pennies in to dollars with the unbelievable job he did building this sales department. And, that's right, the man who KNOWS the revenue before the report even gets sent to the CFO, to get sent to the CEO is the man who bought shares in the company at a strike price of around 58 cents. This guy isn't looking to make 10% on his money. He's not looking to make 20%. I think he knows a deep value when he sees one and thinks this thing is going to explode.

# Summary

The TLDR is I shared my approach to valuing this company and my personal estimate I'm using as a conservative approach is $2.67 to $4.57 as a range but with upside potentially higher, especially if a foreign company needs to buy us to protect from tariff costs and wants to produce locally in the US.

One last random tidbit - Friday had an interesting mention of ELTP in Zack's - an investment website with a good amount of readers. ELTP was named alongside Caterpillar and Charles Schwab - impressive and will likely lead to investors who usually only look at large blue chips to at least be on their radar. That could bring in some new investors over this week.

1mcsdo2,[DD] You Should Probably Not Listen to Most DD Posts Here,1673,289,"TL;DR: Due Diligence posts do not on average predict stock performance any better than random choice

Greetings degenerates. I preface this message by flouting my credentials as a professional quant, yet here I am in the pits of hell nevertheless. I was fascinated by some of absolutely absurd gains coming out of stocks in the very short-term following DD posts here and was wondering if there was a genuine short-term correlation. 

I analyzed 245 DD posts across WSB since December of 2024, scraping a total of 499 different instances of tickers (an instance being a ticker mention in a DD post, the date of the post, and the sentiment associated to the ticker - extracted using Mistral 8x22). Across each ticker reference, I calculated 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, and 30-day returns relative to the S&P 500, and let's just say... not great. Graph time:

You can take a look at the significance testing for the deduplicated results below, though (notice how bullish stocks *underperform* the S&P already after 30 days - although this is not significant):

1mcd2aj,Robinhood Q2 Earnings: Why this week marks the important journey to $200/share,58,104,"Robinhood Markets is set to release its second quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, July 30. Based on a combination of sector trends, internal performance metrics, and analyst sentiment, the company appears well positioned to exceed current consensus estimates. Below is a detailed overview of the primary factors supporting this outlook.
	
1.	Recovery in digital asset trading activity

During the second quarter, the digital asset market experienced a broad recovery in pricing and trading volume. This resurgence was not limited to large-cap cryptocurrencies, but extended across the ecosystem, leading to renewed engagement from retail investors. Robinhood, which offers commission-free access to digital asset trading, benefits directly from these trends.

In addition to volume growth, the company has announced the acquisition of a global crypto exchange and introduced new offerings such as staking and derivatives trading. These developments are likely to contribute to both near-term revenue growth and long-term platform expansion.
	
2.	Interest-based income remains a high-margin growth engine

Robinhood has increasingly shifted its revenue mix toward interest-based income, driven by higher customer cash balances and active margin use. With prevailing interest rates still elevated and user deposits growing, net interest income is expected to remain a strong and stable contributor to overall performance.

Estimates suggest the company generated over $250 million in interest-related revenue during Q2 alone, a significant portion of which is recurring and capital-light. This is a key differentiator that supports margin expansion, particularly in volatile trading environments.
	
3.	Options activity remains elevated

Beyond equities and digital assets, Robinhood has established a strong presence in the retail options space. Options trading tends to generate higher revenue per trade due to its complexity and fee structure, and retail participation in this category has remained consistently high throughout the quarter.

With volatility events occurring at various points in Q2 and increased retail engagement across multiple sectors, the options business is expected to contribute meaningfully to transactional revenue.
	
4.	User base expansion and monetization

While Robinhood‚Äôs user growth remains steady, the more important development is the company‚Äôs improving ability to monetize existing users. Subscription growth through Robinhood Gold, along with increases in average revenue per user, suggest deeper engagement and stronger unit economics.

The company also continues to report growth in net deposits and account funding, which supports long-term recurring revenue potential across multiple product lines.
	
5.	Upward revisions to analyst estimates

Consensus estimates currently sit at approximately $0.31 earnings per share and $912‚Äì915 million in revenue. However, several analysts have raised their targets in recent weeks. For example, Piper Sandler and Morgan Stanley have both raised their EPS expectations into the $0.33‚Äì$0.34 range, citing stronger transaction-based revenue and interest income.

The company‚Äôs Earnings ESP is also positive, which historically has been an indicator of potential earnings beats when combined with upward estimate revisions and favorable sector conditions.
	
6.	Improving operating leverage and profitability

In the previous quarter, Robinhood‚Äôs profitability was overshadowed by commentary on rising operating expenses. However, management has since signaled a renewed focus on cost control and margin preservation. The business has now posted multiple profitable quarters and continues to scale with relatively limited fixed cost expansion.

If Q2 results reflect even modest improvements in expense ratios or cost discipline, it could reframe investor sentiment toward long-term sustainable growth.
	
7.	Market positioning ahead of the report

Implied volatility heading into the report is consistent with the company‚Äôs historical post-earnings movements, suggesting the market is prepared for a meaningful reaction in either direction. Given the setup and the company‚Äôs current trajectory, the risk/reward balance appears favorable for upside if results exceed expectations and guidance is constructive.


Robinhood enters this earnings report with multiple positive indicators in its favor: recovery in digital asset volumes, continued strength in interest income, elevated options activity, improved user monetization, and rising analyst expectations. If these tailwinds are reflected in the financials and forward outlook, the company has a clear path to outperform consensus.

While risks remain‚Äîparticularly regarding expense management and macroeconomic conditions‚Äîthe current setup offers a compelling case for a stronger-than-expected quarter. I‚Äôm ALL IN on my fun yolo account with a 50/50 split in shares and calls.",1753799623.0

1mbx589,Why I think $CZR will disappoint on earnings tomorrow,40,49,"**TL;DR**

Caesars might look undervalued ‚Äî but I think that shit‚Äôs a trap. The company is weighed down by massive debt, slowing tourism due to anti-American sentiment (we all know why), and the economy overall shitting the bed (we also all kinda know why). I believe it deserves to trade lower, potentially in the $25‚Äì$27 range, if near-term trends don't improve (they won‚Äôt).

Feel free to keep reading if you want. Here‚Äôs why I think they got cooked these last few months:

**1. Heavy Debt Load:**  
Caesars owes over $12.3 billion in debt, and with interest rates still high, that‚Äôs a big problem. Even though Caesars brings in solid cash flow, a big chunk goes toward interest payments. That debt load still holds them back ‚Äî especially in a high-rate environment where flexibility and reinvestment matter more than ever.  
(Source: Caesars 2024 10-K)

**2. Vegas Tourism Deceleration:**  
Las Vegas visitor numbers have softened compared to prior quarters, driven by a cooler economy and consumer cutbacks. This threatens RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) across properties.  
In June and July alone, RevPAR fell to 28.7%. International arrivals have also fallen by at least 13.2%, according to STR reports (shocker).

Additionally, this could be leading the company to burn more cash with marketing and promotions to try and mitigate this effect, which could also be eating into their cash flow.  
(Source: [https://www.herelasvegas.com/las-vegas-hotels-performance-declines](https://www.herelasvegas.com/las-vegas-hotels-performance-declines))

**Affected Revenue Mix:**  
Their casino operations are the main income contributor, making up more than half of their revenue. They rely on essentially two types of gamblers:

1. **Casual Gamblers (Low-to-Mid Tier):** These customers represent the bulk of foot traffic and volume. They contribute meaningfully through lower-denomination slots, table minimums, and spend in non-gaming services like dining and hotel stays. This group is particularly sensitive to inflation, credit availability, and general consumer sentiment.
2. **High-Value Players (Whales):** Though smaller in volume, these players disproportionately influence gaming revenue via high-stakes table games and private room play. Their contribution can materially sway quarterly performance, and their behavior is influenced by tax treatment of gambling losses, incentives, and VIP amenities.

This dual reliance creates vulnerability to both macroeconomic softening (which affects casuals) and policy risk (which affects whales). Caesars must navigate this simultaneous exposure carefully, especially during periods of economic and regulatory stress.

* **Middle-Class Pullback:** In 2025, vacation budgets among middle- and working-class households are down 25% ‚Äî dropping from $4,199 to $3,132 on average ‚Äî causing many to skip longer trips, choose staycations, or opt for minimal spending stops. That pullback hits Caesars hard in rooms, slots, and everyday spend. Those are key for Caesars' core revenue. (Source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/15/summer-vacation-spending-slows/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/15/summer-vacation-spending-slows/))
* **Trump‚Äôs BBB:** Changes to gambling loss deductions were also codified into law, and you can now only deduct 90% of losses. I‚Äôm not going to go too much into it. Even though this might not matter to the average degenerate gambler, this could reduce the incentive for 'whale' players to bet aggressively, as well as professional gamblers. Even though casinos don‚Äôt like the professionals, they could nonetheless still take a revenue hit from the whales and pros being more hesitant to bet. With high rollers contributing disproportionate gaming revenue, even a small shift can have a significant impact, despite the changes not taking effect until 2026.

There have been efforts to repeal this change with the FAIR BET Act, but so far, it hasn‚Äôt gained that much traction in the House. This could spell danger for casinos in general, but I think brick-and-mortar locations might be more exposed compared to online casinos.

**5. Caesars Digital Ops:**  
While its digital casinos and sportsbook have grown, its margins remain low relative to DraftKings, FanDuel, and other competitors. Without more cost leverage, it contributes less meaningfully to long-term profitability. Here‚Äôs a table I created for comparison:

https://preview.redd.it/tpkp4gzpipff1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c0d190e3e62e2596797af3c8b5c8da5e631de4b

**6. EPS Inconsistency:**  
CZR has missed EPS expectations in 5 of the last 8 quarters. Despite whatever reasons they‚Äôre giving, they don‚Äôt seem to be consistently delivering what they promised.

https://preview.redd.it/z3sp9posipff1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cc1e7dc7bf13d9cdd854f7695df893891dae813

**Conclusion**  
This analysis identifies Caesars as a structurally leveraged operator facing simultaneous top-line and bottom-line pressure. Weak tourism, reduced casual gambler spending, tax headwinds on high rollers, and digital underperformance combine to create a high-risk environment. Despite a low valuation, I view CZR‚Äôs downside potential as not fully priced in. 

While a relief beat is possible ‚Äî if earnings go slightly better than expected ‚Äî I don‚Äôt believe it can retain the current price for much longer and believe it‚Äôs going to start sliding. **Here are my positions** (I would get more puts if I could, but I‚Äôm broke).

It‚Äôs trading under $30 per share with under $3 billion market cap, the company trades under 4x revenue while comparable but larger CoreWeave trades at like 20x revenue.

Digital Ocean generated $781 million in revenue during 2024 with healthy 13% growth and impressive 42% EBITDA margins, delivering $84 million in net income. Meanwhile, CoreWeave remains cash-flow negative while burning through capital for infrastructure expansion.

Digital Ocean's AI transformation is accelerating rapidly, with AI annual recurring revenue growing over 160% year-over-year. The company has strategically positioned itself in the developer-focused segment with simplified GPU offerings and a comprehensive GenAI platform launched in early 2025. This developer-first approach serves 600,000+ customers across a diversified base, contrasting sharply with CoreWeave's dependence on large enterprise contracts that create concentration risk.

Digitial Ocean‚Äôs stock price should easily double or more. If Digital Ocean achieved just half of CoreWeave's revenue multiple at 9x, the stock would trade around $56, representing 100% upside.

THE DUE DILIGENCE:  

EDIT: EU TRADE DEAL JUST ANNOUNCED, THIS IS A MULTIBAGGER NOW.

‚Ä¢ The market sits at record highs. Google closed Friday under 193 only seven percent below the 52 week high of 207.05.

‚Ä¢ Chart set l up looks clean. A cup and handle that began mid February already cleared the neckline. Last week was month end options expiration (an important date when market makers square their books) so the 195 pin made sense. Price paused at 195 and then fell under it because call open interest there was huge. Dealers pinned it with about 9.5 thousand contracts at that strike. Those contracts expired and the lid comes off.

‚Ä¢ $70 billion buyback cannon:
In April the board reloaded the repurchase program with another $70 billion. That‚Äôs ~5 % of market cap sitting in the wings to sop up any weakness. 

Quiet period freeze out: Most U.S. companies, including Google, impose an internal ‚Äúblackout‚Äù on discretionary buybacks that starts 2 to 4 weeks before quarter end and lasts through at least two full trading days after the earnings release. The gap lets any fresh information settle so repurchases don‚Äôt look like insider trading. 
- Q2 numbers dropped Tuesday night, 23 July.
- Add the standard two trading day buffer (Wed + Thu).
- Friday, 26 July was the first ‚Äúopen‚Äù day when the $70 billion authorization could swing back to full size assuming no other material events pending and no stricter internal policy.

‚Ä¢ Low option pricing. Weekly call implied volatility is twenty six to thirty percent. That is cheap. If price and volume lift, gamma forces dealers to chase and calls can move fast.

‚Ä¢ Pre earnings run absorbed the beat. Shares ran about fifteen percent into the July print, so the pop was priced in. That sets up a fresh leg this week once positioning resets.

‚Ä¢ Search is not dying. Q2 numbers show Google Search and Other revenue of 54.19 billion dollars, up 12 percent year over year. The AI doom story is broken.

‚Ä¢ Why AI will not steal the core. Large language models still stumble on location needs like ‚Äúpizza near me,‚Äù ‚Äúhotels in Miami,‚Äù or live directions. They also fail when users treat the bar as an address book and type ‚Äúchase bank customer service contact‚Äù or ‚Äúx dot com login.‚Äù Habit wins and Google owns that habit.

‚Ä¢ Valuation is still light.

-Google PE 20.6, PEG about 1.0

-Microsoft PE 39.7, PEG roughly 3.3

Microsoft carries nearly double the earnings multiple and more than triple the growth adjusted multiple even though both compete head-to-head in cloud and AI.

‚Ä¢ Macro tail wind. The index is breaking higher, liquidity is strong and tech leads when that happens. Google should print a new all time high above 207 this week if it clears 195 with volume.

‚Ä¢ Longer view. When Google‚Äôs text-to-video tool can pump out five to ten minute clips with story flow, every creator will upload straight to YouTube. That adds a whole new layer of ads on top of the current engine and is a self contained flywheel on steroids. 

‚Ä¢ Capex fears flipped to bullish. Some investors initially balked at Google‚Äôs surge in capital spending, but that knee jerk worry faded fast, being bearish on strategic investment is, frankly, dumb. It‚Äôs like a wife who wanted to be a stay at home mom getting mad at you for working too much. Also, the spend is a one off hit, and Google has a decade long record of turning big capex into bigger returns. That one time off hit was already consumed given the initial reaction to earnings, so it can be ignored now. A slowdown in spending would be the real red flag, signalling the company had lost its confidence in the AI arms race against OpenAI, xAI, and Meta.

‚Ä¢ Cloud flips from drag to driver:
Google Cloud just printed $2.8 billion in operating income with a 20.7 % margin, nearly double last year‚Äôs margin. It‚Äôs no longer the ‚Äúbreak-even someday‚Äù segment. it‚Äôs a profit engine that diversifies away from ads.

Game plan

# Context on Toliara HMS project

First, some context about the Toliara HMS project:

* One of the most promising undeveloped heavy mineral sand projects in the world which can become a major producer of ilmenite+rutile (source of titanium) and zircon
* As a standalone HMS project: Post-tax NPV10 of $1B, 23.8% IRR, 38y LoM, \~2x NPV/initial capex (based on 2021 DFS)

On top of this there is a bolt-on Monazite project to turn what otherwise would be a waste stream, into a lucrative revenue stream. Based on the 2023 PFS:

* Post-tax NPV10 of $1B
* IRR 79%
* NPV/initial capex an impressive 14x (because only modest incremental capex is required)

**Overall, Toliara has a very robust, combined post-tax NPV10 of $2B\* and 3.4x NPV/initial capex**¬†

*\*It‚Äôs not without risks too so don‚Äôt blindly buy $UUUU after reading this post‚Ä¶*¬†

# Deep-dive into transport costs

Now, these are all nice numbers but¬†**how do we determine whether Energy Fuels can realize the value of Toliara via White Mesa Mill?**

https://preview.redd.it/g6ls6c0278ff1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb909dc55eed9b18ca31e0be4f1c5f5eb6eb217b

To answer this question we are going to zoom into the Monazite PFS and¬†**have a look at costs and revenue potential separately**, starting with¬†**costs**¬†first.¬†

Our story starts when the Mineral Separation Plant (MSP) produces a waste stream that‚Äôs \~20% monazite:

1. It‚Äôs further concentrated in a Mineral Concentration Plant (MCP) into a 90% purity Monazite Product
2. Monazite Product is packed into 1 (metric) tonne sealed steel drums and loaded into standard 1 TEU (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit) containers (18 drums per container)
3. Containers are transported by truck to an export facility in Toliara port, \~29 miles from MSP
4. Monazite Product is sold to 3rd parties who process it further into refined products
5. batches of 200 (base) or 100 (alternative case) containers are transferred onto a Class 7 vessel and shipped to Western (USA or Europe) markets.¬†**Critically, all on-shore and vessel chartering (mine-to-overseas) costs are expected to be borne by Base Resources and are priced into the PFS**. In the base case: $10,287/TEU or $571.5/t of product, in total

Our goal in this analysis is therefore to determine the cost of:

1. Importing & processing 200 containers with Monazite Product into US via a port
2. Transporting it to the White Mesa Mill

*Note that I‚Äôm consciously picking the tougher 200 containers-per-shipment case to stress test this thing*

https://preview.redd.it/0ud4las6c8ff1.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b46ebfb4fe62a74561a870760710c762a825348

There are 2 main ports of interest in our analysis:¬†**Houston**¬†and¬†**Long Beach**. It‚Äôs hard to find definitive¬† answers but both appear to have capabilities to handle Class 7 materials in large quantities.

**Import & processing of containers into the US via a port**¬†can be conservatively estimated (under various assumptions and¬†*guestimates*):

* port handling charges: \~$500/TEU
* customs duty: $0 (see¬†[https://hts.usitc.gov](https://hts.usitc.gov/))
* merchandise processing & harbor maintenance fees: $198/TEU
* customs broker, importer security filing, security, wharf, dock, chassis & other fees: $66/TEU

**üëâTotal estimated import & handling charges: $764/TEU or $42.5/t**

The actual numbers differ from port to port and from time to time but the above could give us a ballpark number. Customs duty in particular is something I should spend more time investigating to confirm the estimated number.

The above cost items apply regardless of what happens next‚Ä¶¬†**Speaking of what‚Äôs next, how the hell do we deliver these containers to the White Mesa?**

https://preview.redd.it/6e2fii4n78ff1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=015b8d3878a9e10e8593c5bf4588e107cce48f8d

Since it‚Äôs a back-of-an-envelope analysis (admittedly, a large envelope), we want to consider a wide range of diverse scenarios to establish some kind of average estimates that give us a hope of smoothing out uncertainties and potential incorrect assumptions. We are also only going to look into options that utilize existing infrastructure in ways any other business can.

First relevant observation is that both ports have direct access to rail. With the help of Union Pacific, containerized cargo can be delivered from Long Beach or Houston, to a number of hubs throughout the US, including the most interesting one - the Intermodal Terminal in Salt Lake City.

We are going to assess 4 broad options of delivering the cargo from a port to the White Mesa Mill:

1. ‚öìÔ∏è**Houston Port**¬†\- üöÜUnion Pacific - üÖøÔ∏è**Salt Lake City Intermodal**¬†\- üöõTrucks - üè°**White Mesa**
2. ‚öìÔ∏è**Long Beach Port**¬†\- üöÜUnion Pacific - üÖøÔ∏è**Salt Lake City Intermodal**¬†\- üöõTrucks - üè°**White Mesa**
3. ‚öìÔ∏è**Houston Port**¬†\- üöõTrucks - üè°**White Mesa**
4. ‚öìÔ∏è**Long Beach Port**¬†\- üöõTrucks - üè°**White Mesa**

There are surely many other options possible but these 4 seem to cover the main categories

# Scenario 1: ‚öìÔ∏èHouston Port¬†- üöÜUnion Pacific - üÖøÔ∏èSalt Lake City Intermodal¬†- üöõTrucks - üè°White Mesa

It‚Äôs approx. a 1600 mile ride (exact number may differ depending on the route). Let‚Äôs take a stab at estimating the cost of the rail leg of the journey:

* Standard rate: $3000/TEU (guestimated mid point of long range rates)
* Class 7 premiums for Regulatory compliance, Special packaging, Insurance, Security measures: $6750/TEU (various sources)
* Intermodal terminal transfer fees (rail to truck): $100/TEU

**üëâOverall we can estimate the ship-to-truck cost as $10,614/TEU or $589.7/t**

Fine, so now our containers are loaded onto trucks and ready to go‚Ä¶ well, not so fast. First, let‚Äôs assume that we‚Äôve got a fleet of 20 trucks available (under whatever arrangement), each capable of hauling an \~18t container (well within regulatory limits). Why 20 trucks and 1 container per truck? These are some of the variable that can be optimised but we have to pick some numbers for now.

It‚Äôs a \~322 mile drive to the White Mesa Mill - within the range that I‚Äôve seen companies haul ore from mines to processing facilities in the US in the past (including Energy Fuels). Taking into account the regulatory 11 hour driving time limit, we are just about on the limit for a single driver to do a roundtrip in a day, so let‚Äôs assume an avg of 0.75 roundtrip per day per truck. This will give us avg \~15 containers delivered to White Mesa per day. The entire batch will be transported in \~13 ‚Öì days.¬†

Nothing is for free, so we will amass¬†**dwell fees for approx. $1312.5/TEU (conservatively assuming 1 day Free Time and $250/day/TEU dwell rate)**. Note also that for the sake of being conservative, we assume the entire batch is transported from the port by rail to the Salt Lake City terminal at once, instead of smaller batches to optimise the use of both facilities.

Finally, we need to estimate the cost of the truck part of the journey. During a recent webinar I‚Äôve heard IsoEnergy management share an estimate of 40c/t/mile for transporting uranium ore by truck. It‚Äôs over 120 miles from the mine area they were referring to to the mill. Transporting containerised monazite in sealed steel drums seems to also be easier than raw uranium ore. But for the sake of being conservative lets apply extra 50% contingency, for a total of 60c/t/mile

**üëâPutting everything together, in this scenario, we can estimate the total port-to-mill transport cost at $15,405/TEU or $855.8/t**

This scenario is very similar except we arrive at Long Beach instead of Houston. This cuts the rail leg of the journey by over 50%, to \~700 miles, which I assume can yield \~$1k/TEU cost savings

Unfortunately, nothing comes for free so what distance we reduced on the rail, we need to pay for with a 21-34% (depending whether we go via Panama Canal or around the Pacific) longer route by ship. Panama Canal transit cost seem to fluctuate over time. A couple of calculators I tried for a 500 TEU container ship of the kind we need, returned all-in numbers of <<$200k/transit. To be on the safe side and account for the bigger distance & duration of the journey, let‚Äôs double this buffer to $400k/shipment, $2000/TEU or $111.1/t, on top of the sea freight cost assumed in the Base Resources‚Äô Monazite PFS.

The truck part of the journey remains the same as above.

**üëâIn total, the Long Beach -> rail -> truck scenario comes up at a cost of $16,405/TEU or $911.4/t port-to-mill**

Now, let‚Äôs consider two simpler scenarios (simple != easy ;)) that avoid the use of rail service altogether.

# Scenario 3: ‚öìÔ∏èHouston Port¬†- üöõTrucks - üè°White Mesa

First a disclaimer: I don‚Äôt think this option is likely to be used in practice. I included it since it tests the boundaries of what is or isn‚Äôt possible. This can help arrive at a more sensible average cost

We stick to the 20 truck fleet, each hauling one \~18t container (well within regulatory limits). It‚Äôs a yuge 1168 mile journey by truck from Houston. I assume the roundtrip to and from the port to be a 4 day journey. This gives us an avg 5 containers delivered to the mill per day and 40 days to collect all containers from the port. Assuming 7 day Free Time at the port and a total of $150/day/TEU in¬†**demurrage and dwell fees, we can expect to pay an extra $396k/shipment or $1980/TEU**¬†in those fees. Note also that the longer it takes to collect all containers, the higher the risk that we can be hit by temporary Excessive Import Dwell Fees (in times of high congestion at the port)

As for the truck part of the journey, due to the long-range nature of the route as well as the logistical complexities of stopping overnight, and/or potentially having a second driver onboard, let‚Äôs double the cost per tonne per mile to 80c

**üëâIn total, the port-to-mill cost comes at $19,564/TEU or $1086.9/t - predictably, the highest so far**

# Scenario 4:¬†‚öìÔ∏èLong Beach Port¬†- üöõTrucks - üè°White Mesa

The final scenario we are going to analyze. We land in Long Beach so the same extra $400k contingency for the ocean leg of the journey applies as before. Luckily for us, Long Beach is much closer to White Mesa - 725 miles instead of 1168 miles away or 38% closer to be exact

While we keep the same 80c/t/mile basic cost due to the still relatively long nature of the travel and the potential need for a second driver (the 725 mile trip is slightly more than a single driver can manage in a 11 hour window), the relative proximity compared to Houston manifests itself in two ways:

1. Significantly reduces both risk and cost of the truck leg of the route
2. Slashes the average roundtrip time from 4 to 2 days which means we can collect the entire shipment in 20 rather than 40 days. This in turn translates into much¬†**smaller demurrage and dwell expenses - $117k/ shipment or $585/TEU**

**üëâIn total, the port-to-mill cost comes at $13,789/TEU or $766.1/t - the cheapest and (seemingly) lowest risk scenario**

# Port-to-mill summary

üìú**Port-to-mill transport cost summary across 4 major categories of scenarios:**

1.¬†**Houston**¬†\- üöÜ -¬†**Salt Lake Cit**y - üöõ -¬†**White Mesa**:¬†**$15,405/TEU or $855.8/t**

2.¬†**Long Beach**¬†\- üöÜ -¬†**Salt Lake City**¬†\- üöõ -¬†**White Mesa**:¬†**$16,405/TEU or $911.4/t**

3.¬†**Houston**¬†\- üöõ -¬†**White Mesa**:¬†**$19,564/TEU or $1086.9/t**

4.¬†**Long Beach**¬†\- üöõ -¬†**White Mesa**:¬†**$13,789/TEU or $766.1/t**

üëâThe average is¬†**$16,291/TEU or $905/t**¬†of transport costs unaccounted for in the Toliara Monazite PFS. These are the transport costs that if Energy Fuels were a 3rd party REE refiner, they would need to cover on their own, after purchasing Monazite Product from Toliara.

We use the average number to try smooth out the uncertainties, potential slightly incorrect assumptions and account for the fact that Energy Fuels may choose or need to use more than one route over time. We are also tried being relatively conservative and left lots of room for optimisations (more on this later).

# Deep-dive into revenue potential

Having said all of that,¬†**how likely can Energy Fuels cover these transport costs and achieve the financial outcomes described in the Toliara Monazite PFS or better?**

**üí∞A look at the revenue potential a.k.a can revenue justify the transport cost**

Somewhat counterintuitively, I‚Äôm not going to attempt to predict the revenue or the operational performance of White Mesa processing monazite. I would need to make way too many assumptions for me to have confidence about the conclusions.

üí°Instead,¬†**let‚Äôs imagine for a moment that Energy Fuels are purchasing monazite from Toliara on commercial terms as per the PFS, acting as a 3rd party processor.**

If we look at the cost & revenue structure under such scenario, from the PoV of a 3rd party processor:

**-** (cost) purchase of monazite (includes mine-to-overseas portion of total transportation cost covered by Toliara)

**-** (cost) transport cost from US port to the mill

**-** (cost) all-in costs at the mill

**-** (cost) marketing and shipping costs of finished REE products

**+** revenue from separated/refined REE products

‚Ä¶ we can make 2 important observations:

1. Energy Fuels, unlike most other players (at least in the West), can recover Uranium from the Monazite Product. This represents a source of additional revenue on top of REEs (and is not covered by the Toliara PFS)
2. Margin. If $UUUU were a 3rd party processor, they would need to make their own margin after purchasing monazite from Toliara. For a vertically integrated entity such as the one they are about to become, this margin becomes a source of cost optimisation

Let‚Äôs try to quantify both of these sources of additional revenue and efficiency:

**1. ‚öõÔ∏èUranium as a source of additional revenue for $UUUU from processing of monazite**

Monazite Product coming from Toliara is expected to contain avg 0.319% of uranium in it. If those drums arriving at the port were containing uranium ore, it would be considered pretty high-grade for US hard rock mines (and the rest of it isn‚Äôt waste, it‚Äôs a high-value REE feed).

üí∞If we conservatively assume a 50% recovery rate and a $80/lb LOM sale price, uranium becomes a source of¬†**additional revenue**¬†to the tune of¬†**$331.7/t feed.**

**2.**¬†ü§è**Cost efficiency gain from vertical integration thanks to skipping 3rd party margin**

For a vertically integrated entity such as the one Energy Fuels is about to become, what would otherwise be a 3rd party margin, becomes a source of cost optimisation. After all we care about profitability of the combined entity, not individual parts.

It‚Äôs hard to quantify how big this gain may be, directly. We can look at the handful of publicly traded western REE companies - MP Materials $MP or Lynas $LYC.AX¬†- but none of them are a direct comparison. Many players, especially Asian, are private and/or opaque. The market is boom-and-bust too.

What we can do however, is estimate a lower bound. First let‚Äôs make a conservative assumption based on historical data about the margin: 5%. We don‚Äôt know from what base this 5% should be calculated. What we do know is the sale price of Monazite Product from the PFS. Clearly, a 3rd party processor must make more revenue downstream than the price they paid for monazite feed, for their business to make any sense.¬†

üí∞If we use the average of spot ($5900/t) and the forecasted LoM avg ($8649/t) from Toliara Monazite PFS, we arrive at a¬†**lower bound of cost/margin efficiency gain thanks to vertical integration of $363.73/t or (very likely) more**

https://preview.redd.it/ffjjoh8sc8ff1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0c789cb5e933f21eeaf7b819eb4d871dda738e1

# Putting it all together

**‚ùìDoes it make economic sense for Energy Fuels to ship monazite all the way from Madagascar to a facility in Utah‚ùì**

Putting both sides of the equation together - costs, additional revenue and efficiency gains - we can summarize that:

1. Transport costs from the Madagascar mine to the port and overseas are already priced into the Toliara Monazite PFS¬†
2. **Additional revenue from uranium ($331.7/t) plus cost/margin efficiency gains thanks to vertical integration ($363,73/t) cover at least 81% of the transport costs unaccounted for in the Toliara PFS - from the gate of a port in the US to the mill**
3. The remaining 19% is akin to a 3rd party monazite REE processing facility being located in California or Texas within \~100 miles from the port, rather than in Utah

**üëâTherefore, I believe that Energy Fuels and the White Mesa Mill should not only be able to match the financial outcomes of the Toliara Monazite PFS but can potentially exceed them. The same conclusions can in my view be extended to their Donald HMS project in Australia since the setting is very similar.**

*PS It‚Äôs important to remember that ours, just like most/all models, is likely wrong. What matters is if it‚Äôs close enough to be directionally correct. Have a look yourself and let me know what you think! Also, if you happen to know how to improve any of the assumptions / input variables, please share so that we can make it better! I had to piece together various sources and guestimates since not all of the relevant datapoints are easily accessible. I'm also not a logistics expert by any means*

*PSS I originally posted this analysis on X (* [https://x.com/rekurencja/status/1842580339492810994](https://x.com/rekurencja/status/1842580339492810994) )*. I'm sharing it here since I've noticed more and more people paying attention to $UUUU on here as well!*

# ü§îüí°Addendum 1: Optimise all the things!

Our cost estimates are conservative and we purposefully looked at a difficult scenario of 200 containers per shipment, to stress test the whole setup. In reality there are multiple avenues to further derisk and optimise. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of them.

We could for example:

**1. Play around with the number of containers per shipment**

200 containers per shipment optimises for the cost of sea freight but this is not the most risky or problematic part of the journey. The Toliara PFS includes an alternative case with 100 containers per shipment. It makes the logistics much easier for the price of reducing the Toliara PFS NPV by 6.5%, driven by (according to my estimate) \~$455/t (\~30%) increase in total mine-to-mill transportation cost. It could be possible to find a sweet spot number while pulling some of the levers below to win the NPV back (and more!)

**2. Play around with the number of drums per container**

In our estimates we assumed that each truck can transport 1 TEU container with 18x 1t drums. If we reduced the number of drums per container to 15-16, we could investigate the possibility of transporting 2 containers with a single truck, without the risk of breaking any maximum load regulations in the US. If possible, this would massively improve the efficiency of trucking operations by increasing the load per roundtrip by up to 77% (2x16t vs 1x18t)

**3. Optimise the use of port, rail and other infrastructure**

In scenarios that use both rail and trucks, we purposefully chose not to optimise the use of port, rail and intermodal terminal infrastructure. In practices, once could find more optimal ways of leveraging them to reduce \~dwell and other expenses.

**4. Play around with the size and schedule of the truck fleet operation**

We used a very simple scheme of truck operations. It can be further optimise to e.g. front load the schedule, to collect as many containers before Free Time expires as possible.

**5. Utilize economies of scale to get better deals**

200 containers sounds like a full train worth of containers, scheduled in regular intervals, multiple times per year. This can become a multi-million dollar contract and hence may present opportunities to optimise costs - at least of the rail part of the journey (in scenarios that utilize rail service)

# Addendum 2: There is MoaR

Energy Fuels can and in my view should explore all the optimisation avenues described in the previous post, especially since as you can see here¬†[https://x.com/rekurencja/status/1842652750150238426](https://x.com/rekurencja/status/1842652750150238426), they may yield significant, up to \~30%, improvements in the transport cost per ton.

But since we are having fun here, why not consider also much more speculative and forward-looking ideas that may or may not be possible or make economic sense? For example:

https://preview.redd.it/h3s3akfrb8ff1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8ed02a2415ec533cb510184809cff3f65619be

**üí°Pinyon Plain Mine site as a temporary storage site once the mine ceases operation**

In my estimation (happy to stand corrected though) the Pinyon Plain Mine is going to run out of ore before the end of this decade unless they do more, successful underground exploration. It doesn‚Äôt mean however that the site will cease being useful.

It lies reasonably close to the standard trucking route from Long Beach to White Mesa, so may become a waypoint and/or a temporary storage site for monazite shipments. It isn‚Äôt super spacy but if my ruler math is correct, there may be space to temporarily store over 30 TEUs (possibly quite a bit more). I would imagine (but stand to be corrected) that permits shouldn‚Äôt be a problem since the places I highlighted on the satellite image is likely where ore is stockpiled today.

It‚Äôs hard to quantify the cost benefit this modification would bring and if it‚Äôs doable at all but if it is, it can at least reduce risk (and cost) of cargo staying in the port for too long.

**üí°Any industrial site with rail access as a dedicated terminal for transferring cargo to trucks**

The lack of direct rail access is famously one of the biggest issues of the White Mesa Mill. Having said that, we can combine 2 observations to our benefit:

1. As already discussed, 200 containers sounds like a dedicated train, scheduled in regular intervals, multiple times per year. I‚Äôd imagine that this may open up a possibility of a custom arrangement that could include delivering the cargo to a spot other than the locations available for small customers
2. If you look carefully, there are multiple industrial sites (some active, some defunct) between Salt Lake City and White Mesa, with active rail access (I consider all sites along railroads marked on Union Pacific system map to have active rail)

https://preview.redd.it/6vwrhrigc8ff1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=286d0568f76542a1132a8763b163d53ed99e4d20

https://preview.redd.it/mur7d7lgc8ff1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9911c23c5133589b82eeb4eda8256502d951cb0e

Then there is Moab - to me, the most interesting one and also the closest to White Mesa (86 miles by truck). Moab is a uranium mill tailings remedial site (https://energy.gov/em/moab/overview-moab-umtra-project) managed by the DoE. It‚Äôs is currently shipping \~4 trains a week, each with 156 containers with uranium tailings, to a disposal site up north. The project is currently estimated to be completed in 2029.¬†

‚ù£Ô∏èTechnically this site looks simply perfect:

* active, large-scale rail access
* intermodal infrastructure to easily transfer containers between trains and trucks
* lies on the Highway 191 - the standard route to White Mesa - relatively close to the mill
* lots of space and the right infra for offloading and¬† temporarily (a matter of a couple of days per shipment) storing cargo such as monazite
* going to become defunct in a couple of years despite a lot of capital having been sunk quite recently into it

It‚Äôs impossible for me to say if such an arrangement is possible for formal and other reasons but it‚Äôs surely within DoE‚Äôs mission to support energy and critical mineral security of the US. In this case they could do it at basically zero incremental cost.

üî¢ If we were to put this into numbers and conservatively assume:

* the same cost of UP service as in the Houston scenarios (it‚Äôs actually closer to Moab than it‚Äôs to Salt Lake City), same truck fleet
* 5x higher all-in intermodal handling cost: $500/TEU (vs $100/TEU in Salt Lake City)
* extra contract with the owner of the Moab site (currently DoE) for the use of the terminal \~6 times a year: $1M/yr = $165k/shipment = $825.69/TEU

**The Truth about TPL, Horizon, and the Asset/Liability Mismatch**

**GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH‚ÄôS OPINIONS**

* TPL stock is up over 4x since 2019 due to forced, price insensitive buyers and misplaced confidence in Horizon.
* TPL business is inflecting into a lower quality, capital intensive business with less growth and lower ROICs.
* We believe shares will approach $361-$440 per share, implying¬† 53%-61% downside vs current price.

**SUMMARY OF THE BASES OF OPINIONS**

* TPL stock was up \~100x from 2002-2019, tracking EPS growth, which also grew \~100x. From 2019-2024, however, EPS only grew 1.4x, yet the stock, 4.2x.
* TPL was an ‚Äòindex ineligible trust‚Äô. Horizon led a campaign to change TPL‚Äôs corporate form and succeeded. TPL, thus, became an index eligible corp as of 2021.
* Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street - Price insensitive, forced buyers of the stock ‚Äì increased their combined ownership of TPL stock from <1% in 2020 to 24%, 2025.
* Form 4 filings give the appearance that Horizon Kinetics and its CIO Murray Stahl ‚Äì a board member of TPL ‚Äì are steady and consistent buyers of TPL stock.
* Horizon Kinetics funds have actually been massive sellers of TPL stock since 2019. We calculate that their TPL position has declined by -34% since the end of 2018.
* Horizon‚Äôs TPL position represents \~40% of its equity, and over 30x TPL ADV. We believe Horizon is smart and therefore will continue to sell TPL stock, for risk management purposes.
* TPL claims to be a ‚Äògrowth-oriented enterprise‚Äô yet its employee count has barely grown since 2020.
* A former TPL employee ‚Äì in charge of data center business development ‚Äì believes data centers will be worth at most a few million dollars per year in land lease.
* TPL spent $471 million on acquiring assets in 2024.
* TPL spent more in 2024 on acquisitions, than they did in the previous 22 years (2002-2023) - combined.
* In 2024, TPL purchased oil and gas interests for $34,107 per NRA. Historically their purchases averaged $11,000/NRA.
* TPL‚Äôs has purchased and sold land for $2,569-$2,855 per acre (on a weighted avg basis) over the last 8 years, yet TPL‚Äôs market cap per acre is over $25,000 per acre.
* TPL paid for stock promotion ads in 2024. This is not behavior we expect to see in a S&P 500 constituent.
* Karl Kurz is a member of the TPL Board, since April 15, 2022. Kurz‚Äôs TPL bio fails to mention that he was on BoD of Royal Helium ‚Äì a Canadian penny stock promote until May.

**Landbridge Holdings (""LB""): A Related Party Dance, with a Circular Shuffle**

* We believe false and/or misleading claims have boosted the stock since its IPO on June 28, 2024.
* We estimate shares are worth no more $5 to $24 per share implying 53-89% downside to the current share price.

**SUMMARY OF THE BASES OF OPINIONS**

* We estimate that 16%-55% of 2024 revenue is suspect, not consistent with arms-length, recurring, or market activity.
* The $8 million Data center related party deposit was recognized as revenue upon receipt of the deposit. We don‚Äôt see evidence that the revenue was earned.
* LB‚Äôs reported per barrel produced water royalty fee, exceeds best-in-class TPL‚Äôs fee by 2x. We find this suspect.

1m94ydf,LQDA had a stellar drug launch,66,26,"Some of you may remember¬†[this dd from Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w2yt4g/lqda_long_idea/)¬†three years ago, well LQDA finally was able to launch their drug after dealing with some additional patent trolling from their competitor UTHR and the results for their first month of sales of June came in on wednesday, see below

https://preview.redd.it/49al2dryy1ff1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff9ef8e2e3fd7619add6d6ea8010d42106efad9

LQDA‚Äôs first month sales indicate it is on track to hit almost half of annual starts, first monthly print of 224 prescriptions annualizes at 2688. At 10k/month this means 322mil annual rev. LQDA‚Äôs main competitor serves about 50k prescriptions a year -if LQDA can claw some of these, the TAM is pretty significant. Pharma is pretty sticky so I won‚Äôt speculate there.

Note : I think some of these prescriptions go to PH-ILD patients too, see below for TAM that is a newer market.

https://preview.redd.it/0w0tvirzy1ff1.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=267fa80da22338154f2079f19935300addea7196



LQDA market cap at 1.6 billion and it‚Äôs going to be 5x p/s at the end of this year with a real shot of increasing sales much further. Something interesting about Shkreli‚Äôs first DD is he projected Tyvaso to grow to about 900 mil revenue in 2025 - Tyvaso is doing 1.8 **billion** revenue annualized right now. So this market is clearly growing a lot faster than people were projecting years ago, and there are indications that it could keep growing. I don‚Äôt want to speculate too much because I know jack shit about these diseases, I just think the chart looks like it‚Äôs about to blast through to new highs as wall st digests that this was a killer drug launch and, more importantly, traders are going to look at VRNA which had a similarly good launch and think that perhaps some sort of acquisition is possible.

https://preview.redd.it/y2qdkia1z1ff1.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=b40f65709db01d656e38e3fbeb0c6b66bc5b154c

A lot of people are going to anchor to VRNA‚Äôs acquisition by Merck, I think that is the wrong way to look at this COPD has 8.6 million patients and a lot are untreated from what I understand. I think the VRNA comparisons are wrong for many reasons, but that won‚Äôt keep traders from making them, which is what I think is going to rapidly reprice this over the next few months before the market gets ahead of itself. The only reason I am including VRNA chart below is to show evidence that historically wall street waits until drug launch sales data starts to trickle in before catalyzing a rerate

[VRNA drug launched in august 2024 and sold well](https://preview.redd.it/3ygyv9w3z1ff1.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=339f1b75b680097c1db834bd4db08c80da3d7fcf)

P.S. Shkreli‚Äôs original DD had LQDA getting to 100mil rev in it‚Äôs first year of drug launch, saturating around 27% of market share 5 years after launch. He also had projected that Tyvaso (LQDA competitor) would only be doing 900 mil of revenue in 2025, Tyvaso is on pace to do 1.8 billion. LQDA is on pace to do 300 million in revenue this yr, and if they get 27% of market that‚Äôs 480 million. Shkreli‚Äôs original price target was $20, I have no idea how high LQDA can go but this seems like a pretty good price to buy if you trust his DD.

Every sport you watch is filled with gambling advertisements in the ring, on the court, in the commercials, and soon you‚Äôll be allowed to make day trades with only 2k account value as opposed to the current 25k minimum as a pattern day trader.

The bad stuff. Caesars entertainment currently has a really high debt burden. We‚Äôre talking 25B - and their debt to income ratio is currently sitting at 6.41.

Their free cash flow is projected to reach $930+ million in 2025 and $1.3 billion in 2026 Ôªøwhich should really improve their cash generation.

They have an average rating of Strong Buy by analysts and Morningstar gives them 5 starts with a fair value of $63 (currently sitting at less than half).

As someone who has used multiple sportsbooks, caesars has been giving the more favorable odds the last few months which would bring in more money and given the house edge - the more money coming in, the more money the casino makes long term.

Their earnings report is coming up in a few days. I expect them to beat the estimates and show great potential as the gambling laws are loosening more and allow Caesars to work towards paying down their debt and turn into a big cash cow considering they own a fuck ton of real estate in U.S. and internationally.

1m8wwuz,AMPX DD - Batteries that will (literally) take us to the moon,356,152,"Hi Degens: long time lurker, first time poster with some DD. I tried to post this a couple of weeks ago but didn‚Äôt have enough karma. (Sucks for all of you cause the stock has had a great run) Read, roast me, or scroll past, but here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish AF.

TLDR: Amprius makes silicon anode batteries that destroy traditional lithium-ion cells in every performance metric. They‚Äôre already shipping to defense and aerospace clients (think drones, UAVs, etc.) and drones are so hot right now.

Let‚Äôs get this out of the way first: Amprius makes silicon anode lithium batteries. Not fancy-sounding ‚Äúsolid state‚Äù science projects that need 7 more years in a lab. These batteries actually work, are in production, and are already in the field. Oh and also, they are best in class. 

Energy Density: 2x traditional lithium. Charge Time: as low as 6 minutes. Weight: 50% lighter. Cycle Life: This is the theoretical problem with silicon anodes which has stopped them from being mass-produced. Amprius has figured out a way to get 500 cycles and it‚Äôs been improving.

If you want longer range, lighter aircraft, faster charge, and a power source that doesn‚Äôt need its own backpack, you want this.

These are not hypothetical specs. Drone manufacturers are already using them. Reddit reviews say that these batteries are blowing peoples minds.

WHY NOW?: UAVs, Defense Spending, and a War-Obsessed World

Let‚Äôs talk macro: The world is falling apart and every major power is funneling cash into defense tech like it‚Äôs 1942.

UAVs and drones are so hot right now. They are the future of war. Read the many DDs of drone companies all over Reddit.

Drones need light, energy dense, ultra-fast-charging batteries.

US Defense Dept. has already awarded Amprius contracts.

‚ÄúWe need 500 Wh/kg batteries for tactical edge UAVs.‚Äù -The Pentagon, probably

Add: Rising global tension (Middle east, China, Ukraine) Shift toward electrification of everything in combat=Near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance batteries

And you‚Äôve got the perfect storm for Amprius to dominate military battery tech.

And what if‚Ä¶EVs?

Silicon anode batteries are the holy grail of EVs. Double the range, Half the weight, Full charge while you refill your coffee.

EV makers are all chasing new battery technology. Tesla has talked about it for years, and other OEMs are investing billions in R&D.

But guess what?

Amprius already cracked it. They just need scale.

Their roadmap includes expansion into automotive-scale production by 2026‚Äì2027. They‚Äôre currently sampling cells to automakers, and pilot programs are underway.

This is the classic ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù play. catch them before they hit the big leagues.

And they have actual sales: This Ain‚Äôt a Science Fair Project

Revenue is already ramping: Q1 2024: Revenue up 225% YoY , Multiple new clients added in aerospace, drones, and defense. They literally can‚Äôt make these batteries fast enough, and have partnered with manufacturers in South Korea for extra capacity.

2025 and 2026 will be inflection years as new facilities go online.

Also: Insiders are NOT selling. In fact, there‚Äôve been multiple buys and strategic investments in recent months.

This is not a pump and dump dead company or some bs startup selling a ChatGpt wrapper. This is a real company, shipping a real, game-changing product, with: Massive tailwinds from global defense spending, A potential EV expansion catalyst, Crazy asymmetric upside from a $900 market cap and oh yeah‚Ä¶ they have no meaningful competition. There are a couple other companies trying to crack silicon but Amprius already has.

Most recent analyst price target is $15. And analysts, as we know, are never wrong.

THE RISKS (Because I‚Äôm probably a Degenerate) Production scale risk: Can they actually build enough? Competition: Big dogs like Tesla/Panasonic could play catch-up. Battery industry is cutthroat and capex-heavy. Still not profitable (this is WSB, do we care?)

But remember, we‚Äôre early. Like pre-Model S Tesla early.

Buy a few shares. Forget about them. Come back when your fridge has a drone delivering your groceries, and it‚Äôs powered by Amprius. 

Positions: Long (obviously) 3000 shares. NFA. I‚Äôm just a degenerate and drone enthusiast. DYOR. Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose, but be prepared to win.

üçï YOLO‚Äôd $45K on $PZZA $57.50 Calls ‚Äî Betting on a Buyout in the 60s üöÄ

Alright degenerates ‚Äî I just dropped $45K in premium on Papa John‚Äôs $57.50 calls because the oven‚Äôs heating up and this pizza might be getting taken private.

Reuters dropped a spicy leak: Apollo Global and Irth Capital (yes, the Qatari-backed fund that already owns ~5% of $PZZA) have submitted a take-private bid valuing the company in the low $60s.

Stock popped to ~$54 on the initial rumor ‚Äî since then, it‚Äôs cooled back to the upper $40s. Perfect entry point.

‚∏ª

üß© The Setup
	‚Ä¢	Irth Capital already owns 5% ‚Äî they‚Äôre not window-shopping.
	‚Ä¢	Apollo has serious fast-food buyout pedigree: Qdoba, Chuck E. Cheese, Wagamama. This is their lane.
	‚Ä¢	Reported valuation: ~$1.7B‚Äì$2B, implying low $60s per share. That‚Äôs a ~30% premium to where the stock sits today.
	‚Ä¢	Street analysts say the math checks out ‚Äî around 14.5x EBITDA, not some meme multiple.

‚∏ª

üí∏ My Play

Loaded the boat on $57.50 strike calls, aiming squarely at a buyout in the 60s.

Breakeven is under the rumored takeout price ‚Äî if this thing hits, those calls are going deep into the crust.

If the deal‚Äôs real? I‚Äôm printing.
If we get a bidding war? I‚Äôm retiring.
If it flames out? I‚Äôm eating frozen DiGiorno and bagholding a dream.

‚∏ª

üì° What I‚Äôm Watching
	‚Ä¢	SEC filings ‚Äî any 13D/13G/A from Irth or Apollo = game on
	‚Ä¢	Follow-up reporting or leaks from Semafor, Reuters, etc.
	‚Ä¢	PZZA holding >$54 on volume = possible gamma lift
	‚Ä¢	Other bidders sniffing around ‚Äî Roark, Inspire, etc. could add fuel

‚∏ª

This is either a surgical options trade on a credible take-private‚Ä¶ or a $45K grease fire.

But Papa didn‚Äôt step down for me to play it safe.

$PZZA to the 60s ‚Äî no stop loss, extra garlic butter.

**My Thesis is Simple:**

The market is acting emotionally, and I'm acting rationally. The post-earnings price drop was a textbook case of IV crush combined with a market overreaction. While everyone was freaking out about the intraday swing, the actual long-term story only got stronger.

This dip to $191 was great, for my covered calls I sold.

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not sweating the daily noise:

1. **The $106 Billion Backlog:** This isn't a forecast. It's a backlog of committed orders, mostly for their high-margin cloud and AI services. This is future revenue that's already on the books.
2. **The $85 Billion CapEx:** This isn't speculative spending. They are building the infrastructure required to service that massive backlog. They are investing in the machinery to print cash for the next five years.
3. **The AI Moat:** Gemini's integration across the entire Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Cloud) is a long-term catalyst that the market is still struggling to price correctly.

People who sold today traded a long-term winning strategy for short-term fear. I believe the path to a $3 Trillion valuation ($250/share) is clear, and the market just gave us a beautiful discount.

|Throughput|**2.90‚ÄØMb/d**|2.85‚ÄØMb/d|\+0.05‚ÄØMb/d|

Realized refining margin was $2/bbl lower than what I modeled due to a combination of

\-Lower diesel, gasoline cracks early in the quarter than I modeled

\-Valero capture ratio for headline crack was lower than I expected

\-Heavy crude discounts were less than I modeled

\-Renewable fuel projects swung to loss

Earnings report came in well below what I modeled, but still a solid beat on the street numbers. I thought Q3 guidance of around $15/bbl realized margin was materially positive. Of course the print is -5% today so what do I even know anymore

1m8ao31,Crocs-Pot of Gold: Uncovering the Infinite Money Glitch,589,208,"I know what WSB is thinking, another ""infinite money glitch"" post. But hear me out because this is so absurd, so unbelievably simple, tied to the most hideous footwear on the planet that it just **MIGHT** work. And if it does, we're all retiring to a private island with **UNLIMITED** pairs of Crocs.

I'm talking about **Crocs call options.**

Now, before you dismiss me as a madman who's spent too much time sniffing Croslite. Crocs against all odds has been crushing it. People love them, hate them, but they **buy** them. They're comfortable, versatile (especially when you put them in 4-wheel drive), and apparently, recession-proof.

Here's the ""glitch"" and how we get rich with Unlimited pairs of Crocs:

**Step 1: Buy Crocs Call Options.** Start small. The idea is to buy calls with an expiration slightly after their upcoming earnings on August 7^(th). Crox has been buying back a ton of their own shares at the P/E multiple of 6 (highway robbery at these prices). Earnings are going to crush come August and Crox will rerate. Once they crush and our calls go brrrrr, we go into step 2.

**Step 2: Cash Out & Buy a couple pairs of Crocs Shoes.** This is the crucial part of the ""glitch."" Take a portion of your profits from the options and buy a couple pairs of Crocs before the next earnings cycle.

**Step 3: Repeat the Cycle.** Now we have \*free\* physical Crocs which boosted Crocs Revenues and Profits and also have more calls. **Every pair of Crocs you buy with your options gains contributes to the ongoing demand for Crocs pushing the stock price higher for the next round of call options.**

It's a prophecy of rubbery goodness! We continue the cycle until we have a lifetime supply of Crocs and a lifetime supply of gains.

TLDR; Buy CROX calls with an expiration date after earnings, use your gains to buy more calls and Croc shoes for the next earnings. Repeat until retired on the beach wearing Crocs. (also I'm poor so only have 10 calls to start)

1m7qn26,Chime Financial - Fintech Disruptor,22,20,"# $CHYM DD: Chime Financial - Fintech Disruptor with Growth Catalysts

**TL;DR**: Chime ($CHYM) targets 196M underbanked Americans with no-fee banking and innovative products like MyPay, Chime+, and Chime Workplace. 30%+ revenue growth, Q1 2025 profitability, and a shift to in-house payment processing (ChimeCore) set it up for a breakout. $40 calls are heating up for August 7 earnings. **Positions**: 500 shares, 10 Aug $40 calls.

---

## The Opportunity: Massive Underbanked Market

Chime is a digital banking platform serving Americans earning $30K-$100K (196M people, <3% penetration), who hate bank fees and live paycheck-to-paycheck. They‚Äôre expanding to households up to $200K (227M total addressable market), with nearly half of >$100K earners financially stretched. Key stats:

- 8.6M active users, up 82% since 2022.
- 67% consider Chime their primary bank.
- 90%+ retention after direct deposit setup, making users sticky.
- Targets tech-savvy Gen Z/Millennials (18-35, avg credit score 590).

This underserved market, combined with Chime‚Äôs no-fee model, positions it to capture significant share from traditional banks.

---

## Financial Performance: Growth and Profitability

Chime‚Äôs financials show strong momentum and a path to profitability:

| Metric                 | Value                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2024 Revenue           | $1.67B (+30.9% YoY)         |
| Q1 2025 Revenue        | $518.7M (+32% YoY)          |
| TTM Revenue            | $1.80B                      |
| 2024 Net Loss          | -$25.3M (-87.5% vs 2023)    |
| Q1 2025                | Profitable (first time)     |
| Market Cap             | $11.09B ($35.60/share)      |
| IPO Price/Opening      | $27/$43 (+37% pop)          |
| Next Earnings          | August 7, 2025              |

- **Revenue Driver**: 72% from interchange fees (users swipe debit cards 54x/month).
- **Cost Structure**: $1.4B in marketing (2022-2024) fuels growth, offset by high retention.
- **Profitability**: Q1 2025 profitability is a milestone, though EBITDA margin is -2.22%, indicating room for improvement.

---

## New Products: Chime+ and Chime Workplace

On March 31, 2025, Chime launched two game-changing updates:

- **Chime+ Premium Membership** (free with qualifying direct deposits):
  - 3.75% APY on savings (vs. 0.45% national average).
  - Custom cashback deals with top retailers, boosting transaction volume.
  - Priority customer support for faster issue resolution.
  - Enhances user engagement and retention. [Source: Chime Newsroom](https://www.chime.com/newsroom/news/chime-launches-premium-membership-tier-and-more-than-a-dozen-new-features-in-redesigned-app/)

- **Chime Workplace**: A financial wellness suite for employers, offering tools to improve employee financial health. With two-thirds of workers seeking such benefits, this B2B play diversifies revenue beyond consumer banking.

These launches, part of a redesigned app with features like FICO score tracking and credit building, strengthen Chime‚Äôs ecosystem.

---

## MyPay: Disrupting Predatory Lending

Chime‚Äôs MyPay offers $20-$500 paycheck advances with no interest or mandatory fees ($2 for instant access). Compare to:

- Payday loans: Up to 652% interest.
- Credit card advances: 17.99%-29.99% interest.

Targeting fee-sensitive users, MyPay drives loyalty and interchange revenue, disrupting predatory lenders and locking in users for long-term growth.

---

## Business Model: Scalable and Defensible

Chime‚Äôs lean model gives it an edge:

- **No Physical Branches**: Lower overhead vs. traditional banks.
- **Higher Interchange Fees**: Non-bank status avoids regulatory caps.
- **No Credit Risk**: FDIC bank partnerships (e.g., The Bancorp, Stride Bank) eliminate loan losses.
- **Sticky Users**: Direct deposit makes Chime the default bank for 67% of users.

Competitors like SoFi, PayPal, and Square are strong, but Chime‚Äôs focus on the underbanked and no-fee model sets it apart.

---

## ChimeCore Catalyst: In-House Processing

Chime is transitioning from Galileo Financial Technologies (SoFi-owned, acquired for $1.2B in 2020) to its own processor, **ChimeCore**. By end-2024, credit card transactions moved to ChimeCore, with debit cards likely transitioning by mid-2025. Benefits include:

- **Cost Savings**: Cutting Galileo‚Äôs fees could add millions to the bottom line.
- **Operational Control**: Reduces reliance on SoFi and mitigates outage risks (e.g., Galileo‚Äôs 2019 issues).
- **Market Impact**: Analysts estimate a 20%+ stock pop on completion. [Source: Chime S1 Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1795586/000162828025025059/chimefinancialinc-sx1wq1da.htm)

Execution risks (technical delays, integration costs) exist, but margin expansion potential is significant.

---

## Analyst Sentiment: Bullish Outlook

Analysts are optimistic, with 13 ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings and a $37.75 average price target (~6% upside from $35.60):

| Analyst            | Rating       | Price Target |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Evercore ISI       | Outperform   | $38          |
| William Blair      | Outperform   | -            |
| Piper Sandler      | Overweight   | $40          |
| Morgan Stanley     | Bullish      | -            |

This reflects Chime‚Äôs strong product-market fit and growth potential. [Source: StockAnalysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/chym/forecast/)

---

## Options Flow: Bullish Bets

- Heavy volume in $40 calls (30% upside from $35.60) signals institutional interest.
- High volatility (beta 4.79) makes it a WSB-friendly play.
- August 7 earnings could spark a move if Chime beats and raises guidance.

---

## Bull Case: Why This Could Pop

- **Massive TAM**: <5% penetration, 95% growth runway in a 227M market.
- **Profitable Growth**: 32% revenue growth, Q1 2025 profitability.
- **Innovation**: Chime+ and Chime Workplace drive engagement and new revenue.
- **Catalysts**: August earnings, ChimeCore transition, upmarket expansion.
- **Valuation**: Below IPO high ($43), with analyst targets suggesting upside.

---

## Risks to Consider

- **Economic Sensitivity**: Low-income users may cut spending in a downturn.
- **Competition**: SoFi, PayPal, Square, and adapting banks pose threats.
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential fee caps could hit interchange revenue.
- **Valuation**: Rich at $11.09B with no P/E (TTM EPS -$0.43).

---

## Positions

- 500 shares
- 10 Aug $40 calls

## Verdict

Chime‚Äôs a fintech leader with a massive market, strong growth, and catalysts like ChimeCore and new products. Analyst support and options flow point to upside, especially post-earnings.

**2Q 2025 Setup for beat**

Street consensus forecasts for ($VLO) earnings tomorrow is \~$1.77, way too low. Plugging in historical numbers from crack spreads, crude feeds and utilization rates for USGC refiners over 2Q 2025 suggests adjusted EPS well above $3.

|Diluted EPS|**$3.90**|$4.10‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ5.00|**$9.7**|

Reasons for divergence from street forecast:

\-Analyst used prevailing crack spreads in May, did not capture crack spikes in June for gasoline and especially diesel, which were about $3-5 higher.

\-USGC refiners, especially Valero, use a high mix of discounted heavy crudes such as Mexican Maya. These run on the order of $10 discounts to benchmark crude prices and aren't accounted in models

\-Valero's top tier refining operations easily pivots between refining cuts, letting them quickly capture elevated diesel cracks that emerged towards the end of the quarter

\-Valero owns their export docks making their sizable exports materially cheaper than peers.

**3Q 2025 Guidance and Beyond**

Cracks are even higher today pushing near $30, and likely setup to increase further with Gulf hurricane season and refinery maintenance season upon us. Extreme weather this summer has increased diesel burn to buffer stressed electricity grids, and diesel inventory stocks are far below baseline all around the Atlantic Basin. Despite the amazing refining profits to be made in this environment, refineries around the Atlantic Basin have actually been **shutting down** due to an unfortunate variety of idiosyncratic factors:

**\_\_\_**

\-UK Lindsey refinery shutting down **right now,** despite being highly profitable at today's cracks, due to corporate malfeasance putting refinery into bankruptcy administration

\-UK Grangemouth and LyondellBasell's Houston refineries both shut down earlier this year despite high cracks. Many refineries in EU are skipping capex, cutting capacity due to high costs all around.

**EU refinery losses are a structural tailwind for USGC refiners like Valero who can easily ship product across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

\-PEMEX refineries in Mexico are running far below nameplate capacity due to lack of maintenance. PEMEX has stiffed contractors, including refinery EPCs, on the order of $20 billion in unpaid bills; they aren't fixing up their refineries anytime soon due to debts and contractor distrust. Many PEMEX refineries are past maintenance dates and essentially on a run to failure model with high risk of unplanned, permanent outages.

\-Many LATAM refineries have same issues as PEMEX, refineries far past maintenance dates, a history of stiffing contractors, and no cash to pay up contractors. Ecuador's Esmeraldas¬†refinery has been completely shut down since May due to earthquake and fire damage; they still haven't been able to contract repairs for the refinery blocks.

\-Petrobas is well funded, but their Brazilian refineries are also long overdue for turnaround maintenance, scheduled for the next few months. This shuts down even more Atlantic Basin refining capacity right when cracks are juiciest.

**LATAM refinery shutdowns are bullish for Valero because it means these markets, especially Mexico, will continue devouring product from USGC refiners, and frees up cheap crudes like Mexican Maya for USGC refiners as well.**

**\_\_\_**

\-Ukraine, Russia, Israel and Iran may not agree on much except blowing up each other's refineries, all the easier with today's cheap FPV drones. Recent refinery casualties include Bazan, Tabriz, Kremenchuk, Lysychansk, Ryazan‚ÄØ, and Volgograd

\-War all around is another tailwind for refining product demand, especially diesel to fuel heavy military vehicles like tanks and backup generators when power grids are sabotaged

**Refinery casualties from these conflicts all tighten product balances in the Mediterranean, yet another export destination for USGC refiners like Valero that are just a short hop across the Atlantic.**

**\_\_\_**

**Bottom Line**

I'm bullish for tomorrow's earnings report simply due to the hard numbers penciling out a material beat. I'm bullish long term due to a combination of structural factors that knock out their competition across the Atlantic Basin, leaving juicy profits for the prime, export-oriented USGC refiner that is Valero.

1m7h10s,[DD] Applied Digital - $APLD - Slept On Data Center Stock with a Real Business Growth Story and Huge Potential,126,104,"Reposting with positions since removed

TLDR: Stock go up 

Applied Digital owns and leases data centers for hyper scaler clients. In plain english‚Ä¶ AI. While there is a buttload of competition in this space, there is an even larger buttload of money.

OpenAI recently agreed to pay $30B per year to Oracle for data centers leasing. APLD also recently signed a $7B lease contract with CoreWeave with the option to expand the lease by more than double the current MW as APLD builds out additional data center capabilities. Keep in mind that as AI adoption grows, data centers prices rise. OpenAI and Google are both prime examples of these price increases, as both organizations have and plan to continue to jack up prices as demand increases. Higher prices = higher revenues for APLD.

Applied Digital also has $5 billion in funding secured from Macquarie with $900M being used for current buildout and $4.1B for expansion. Perfectly situated to capitalize on the opportunity in hand.

So what are the catalysts? The better question is what aren‚Äôt the catalysts.

Current market cap is just shy of $2.5B with $5B in funding and $7B contract‚Ä¶

An additional lease signing could drive the stock 2-10x as APLD has the funding to expand operations without the need for additional dilution. As the CoreWeave money comes in, higher than expected margins would also trigger a powerful re-assessment of valuation. Trump could announce additional AI and data center investment/tax incentives/etc‚Ä¶

Now if you‚Äôve made it this far and know anything about the stock, you might have realized something‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the fact that 35% of the float is short. With so many potential catalysts that could increase the value exponentially, this is just the cherry on top.

My short term price target is $15-20 with a 3 year target of $80.

üêØ Tiger Brokers ( $TIGR ) is clawing its way to the top of Oceania's digital brokerage jungle and it's doing it with haste, roaring fundamentals and stealth...  
  
üí°Simple thesis, if we just assume $TIGR is the worst broker, it still has the fundamentals supporting a double BUT I will also demonstrate by comparison why it is actually a crazy growth opportunity. You can even get hands on yourself without an account and explore some of the app- ‚û°Ô∏è Tiger Trade ‚¨ÖÔ∏è on the respective app store(s).  
  
üìù Small note, *I wrote this all by hand, got the data by manually and made the charts by hand, no AI. If you think this is AI you don't know shit, STFU and say thank-you before you move on to spamming posts with ""Old WSB had real DD now its just meme stock posts"".*  
  
üìä OK, lets start with Fundamental Comparisons, I've made pretty pictures for you:  
  
$TIGR $HOOD $FUTU 

[Most importantly, the last chart, it has room to 5x the marketcap.](https://preview.redd.it/rf937nhdimef1.png?width=1661&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abf8a7a56e6ac772aa91c87f608bfce08144547)

# **Outrageously Undervalued.**



üí∏ Lets talk about cash flow Cash Flow. P/C (Price to Cash) = 0.5. Insane. $TIGR has so much cash that it's enterprise value is negative, that means if you bought all of $TIGR at its current market cap, including paying all its debt you would have more cash then you spent buying the company. How much would you profit? About 1.5 Billion (‚úåÔ∏èdouble-up) 



üõí This could also make it a potential target for acquisition, it has a smart team + tons of global regulatory approvals already. Meanwhile $HOOD has been working on Singapore approval for nearly a year now.



üç¥ $TIGR Q1 earnings was for the giant drawdown period and it still looked amazing. Since then we've had a jarringly fast recovery and new Crypto highs, expect Q2 to be a huge beat, analysts are out to lunch.



üéâ I think a **24%** surprise beat on revenue and **100%** beat on earnings.

\- Revenue/Earning Estimate      |   118M / $0.10

\- Revenue/Earnings Prediction   |   146M / $0.20



üò§ ""Yeah but-""

but what if $HOOD comes to Oceania? 

\- $HOOD is more expensive and doesn't actually have more features than $TIGR, it would be hard to convince people to switch who already use a platform just like $HOOD but pay much less for it. Admittedly Robinhood does have a better user experience and I would say their UI implementation is bar none the best for retail.



but $FUTU is bigger and safer!

\- It is bigger and safer annnnnd has less room to appreciate, already trading at a premium to $TIGR but I'd say its still undervalued as well. Both stocks move with each other fairly consistently, I just prefer the one with more reward for my risk. $TIGR can increase it's profit margin 2x and its user base (to a lesser degree) if it does that in 2026 the stock will trade at $40+.  



but if Trump delists China Stocks its fked!

\- $TIGR is based in Singapore. It serves clients in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, China and even the US.



but you didn't show up $HOOD EPS Y/Y, its > 1000%, way more than any other broker!

\- Every company EPS looks amazing coming from NEGATIVE earnings, I provided the positive Q/Q.



but it already ran up!

\- Good stocks go up smh, I just posted all the reasons why it has so much more room, above, in picture form, for your smooth brain.



üí∞ Wealth Management = Sticky Growth

Tiger is leaning heavily into Wealth Management, adding high-quality revenue streams and stickiness. Think Schwab or IBKR, but at an earlier and cheaper stage. This is a great fit for the region which is now transitioning to stock investments at a higher rate due to turmoil over the last few decades in real-estate markets.

ü´∞ Massive valuation gap vs. peers. $TIGR could double and still look cheaper than all the competition.

üì¢ Smart expansion into high-value regions and dominating early with profitable marketing.



üß† Management execution has been impressive. They're beating guidance handidly and scaling products/features.

1m74nu8,408K -> 800K YOLO INTO IOVA AND WHY THIS IS JUST THE START,1675,723,"**TLDR: IOVA's current rise marks the very beginning of a year-long short squeeze. Both the technical and fundamental set-up (34.5% short interest) makes this one of the best opportunities I have seen in a very long while. A price target of 10-15$ is very achievable.**

Two months ago I posted a 408K YOLO into IOVA with ten points of DD (I highly recommend you read this if you haven't already as I outline the basics of the company + main theses there): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k\_yolo\_into\_iova/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kqhzj0/408k_yolo_into_iova/)

Since then, the stock has risen over 80% on multiple positive updates and my position grew to 800K (after I also added \~12k shares). I believe that a few recent developments, however, are so substantial that they warrant a new post, and my conviction in the stock has never been higher.

**Fundamentals are improving rapidly - much faster than sell-side and shorts expected:**

1. Replimune's RP1 was IOVA's biggest competitive threat, and the **rejection of their flagship therapy by the FDA yesterday** means that Amtagvi will be able to maintain its monopoly in the late-stage melanoma field: [https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics](https://ir.replimune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/replimune-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-rp1-biologics)

Investors who have been following the stock should know just how much of a threat REPL seemed to IOVA, and how bullish the CRL is for IOVA's operations in the next few years. This is especially the case given that IOVA has been trying to make the push into being used at earlier stages. REPL's stock dropping 77.24% yesterday signals the market's belief that they will likely need to redo their study entirely, using randomized controlled studies this time. 

https://preview.redd.it/r9vbi3835lef1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e741664ada64971562e6f47f7accd3316c215b5

2. **Recent commercial data from IOVA has been very, very, very impressive**. A July 14 study found that Amtagvi's ORR among real world patients who have received multiple lines of prior therapies was **49%**. For patients who have received 2 lines of therapies or less, the ORR was **60.9%**: [https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir](https://ir.iovance.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-demonstrate-49-response-rate-commercial-amtagvir)

https://preview.redd.it/pzazo1mq8lef1.png?width=2532&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b1ef07a462b0a57fbb7cbb9ac4b418f194748a

This is truly **miracle-drug level numbers for melanoma**, and hence the widespread excitement in the medical industry. Many of these responses were also highly durable lasting many years following a single treatment. In other words, for many patients who have tried and failed other therapies and thus are losing hope, Amtagvi provides a 49% chance of extending your lifespan by years (and a chance of complete recovery). The fact that 250m Americans are covered by insurance for this treatment means that the 500k treatment cost is manageable for consumers, but represents significant revenue for IOVA. Here is an excellent video from the Director of Melanoma Medical Oncology at the Stanford Cancer Center discussing the therapy:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA\_DJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA_DJc)

https://preview.redd.it/alpyhir3elef1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb2314be33b4c4c81090049aab20d48463b85425

Such data, along with the rejection of RP1, will help them push into earlier lines of therapy, enabling a  rapid revenue ramp up over the coming year. Management forecasts a steady state of 1bn in annual revenue and 80% gross margins - which seems more and more achievable given the RP1 rejection.

3. **Q2 recovery is imminent with a stronger team**. In the Q1 earnings call, management has repeatedly mentioned that Q2 demand was very strong, and that they are capable of beating their lowered guidance. This was reinforced by physician comments during their Investor Event at ASCO where they mentioned that treatments really picked up in April: [https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event](https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/iovance-biotherapeutics-asco-investor-event)

Their strategy of moving into earlier treatment stages and utilizing community referrals will also play out over the next year under the new CCO Dan Kirby (who seems to be highly competent - you can find him speaking here: [https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/goldman-sachs-46th-annual-global-healthcare-conference](https://ir.iovance.com/events/event-details/goldman-sachs-46th-annual-global-healthcare-conference)

The new CFO, Corleen Roche, who joined from the more established CG Oncology also brings much needed experience to the team (she has worked in the field for 30+ years). 

**Technicals - one of the most insane short-squeeze set ups I've seen**

1. The stock is currently one of the most heavily shorted tickers out there, with **short interest at 34.53%.** By comparison, OPEN only has a short interest of **20.7%** **and the fundamental improvement of IOVA > OPEN by a significant margin.** 

https://preview.redd.it/nyodjhet5lef1.png?width=2340&format=png&auto=webp&s=12cc9db4b6c715dd86a4313f4e29a025849a371d

Furthermore, **81.33% of shares are held by institutions** (with 8.41% held by Wayne Rothbaum, one of the most successful biotech investors of all time who also sits on the board), and **17.97% are held by mutual funds**. This means that the amount of shares traded among retail is very limited (0.32% OS), further improving the technical set up and the potential for a squeeze. 

https://preview.redd.it/bmdes461blef1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b2dd815fecfd2008fe8cdd3ecf912d1efd49369

**For a short squeeze to not be a short-lived pump and dump, the fundamentals must justify the short squeeze** (many forget this). In this case, it seems that the **hedges who drove the 34.53% short interest has been caught with their pants down**, as the fundamentals improved significantly faster than they expected. Indeed, much faster than I expected as well and I have been closely following the stock for a while and am biased to be long given the hype from my friends in pharma.

**Here are my positions, I will not sell a single share until my price target of 10$+.**

1m6v5cz,MOST Undervalued hidden gem $GLXY,218,95,"The biggest laggard of all crypto stocks is possibly $GLXY and let me tell you why.

They recently migrated from TSX to NASDAQ. As a result, they have been very muted and frankly novogratz mentioned that they will have more access to capital via US market (aka nobody cares about Canadian stock). 

Now this really is one of the main theses about why this is a hidden gem. There has been a lack of media coverage and analyst coverage because they just got listed on US exchange. In fact, I recently just found out about galaxy digital being on the US exchange as well.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the business and about Mike Novogratz

1) Galaxy Digital is at the intersection of the two biggest narratives in the market right now, which is crypto and HPC. First of all novogratz had the vision. They started off as a BTC miner and Novogratz now, he‚Äôs got the vision to convert all of their compute into a data center as they are in the process of converting all of it into a data center. 

2) HPC/AI Pivot: A major strategic move by Galaxy is its pivot from pure crypto mining into High-Performance Computing. In April 2025, Galaxy inked a 15-year deal with CoreWeave (a fast-growing AI cloud provider) to host AI workloads at Galaxy‚Äôs huge Texas data center campus. Galaxy is converting its former bitcoin mining facility (‚ÄúHelios‚Äù) to provide 133¬†MW of power for CoreWeave‚Äôs AI/HPC servers, to be fully delivered by mid-2026  

3) Crypto Business: In addition to their HPC/AI pivot, Galaxy Digital is also one of the OG crypto businesses which operate in crypto trading, asset management, and investment banking firm in the crypto space.

Galaxy‚Äôs Global Markets division profits from market making and OTC trading for institutions, which flourishes when crypto interest is high Ôøº. Its venture investment portfolio (valued ~$736 million in Q1) includes stakes in many crypto startups ‚Äì as the sector recovers, some of these investments could appreciate or be monetized. 

Galaxy is also capitalizing on increasing institutional adoption of crypto, as more banks and funds enter the space (now over 60% of crypto trading volume is institutional Ôøº). Galaxy‚Äôs recent registration as a U.S. swap dealer and launch of a $160M venture fund are aimed at serving this institutional wave. **And this is only expected to get bigger given the GENIUS act**. 

Also I should mention that Galaxy Digital will also benefit largely from the Stablecoin act as well, and they have been a large supporter of lobbying for support from the government.

So if you are telling me a stock such as BMNR, SBET, BTBT can moon by switching their treasury to ETH, just think about what Galaxy can hold. 

And this is only because of the lack of media coverage on this company.

4) Upcoming Earnings Report: Galaxy Digital is set to report their first earnings report as a US listed stock on Aug 5th (which they moved up ahead of time) and just announced recently. Here is what the expectations are:

In Q1 2025, Galaxy reported a large net loss of $295‚ÄØmillion (‚âà$0.86 per share loss) due to the steep drop in crypto prices during Q1 and a one-time $57‚ÄØM impairment for winding down its mining rigs at Helios Ôøº. By contrast, for Q2 the company provided guidance that, as of mid-Q2, it had already generated $160‚Äì$170‚ÄØmillion in operating income. Moreover the company is expected to announce strong growth outlook in terms of its HPC and Crypto business operations as they are also a market maker/custodian as well. 

**Also one of the most important facts is the fact that Galaxy Digital will be getting more analyst coverage since they just migrated to the US exchange. And by releasing this earnings reports it will provide more guidance for analysts. Right now there are only like ~3 firms which have rated this company as a strong buy**. 

I believe we will see more of this just based on the fact that crypto stocks have done tremendously well because of the GENIUS act.

4) Lastly, everything Novogratz touches turns to gold as well.

5) Another user also posted a DD here (which I won‚Äôt repeat)

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/rqq4iY5U16

TLDR: Galaxy was previously listed on TSX which nobody cares about and as a result, they lacked the proper coverage that US firms does. As they report their earnings on Aug 5th, there will be more analyst coverage who would rate this stock as a strong buy. 

Moreover they will simply have more access to capital because nobody trades on the TSX. As a business that operates at the intersection of AI and crypto, you are telling me that they aren‚Äôt going to moon ?

Position: 24k shares, now take me to the moon Novogratz.

It adresses the muscle wasting problem if glp1.  Pub med has articles on why this also accelerates strength when you do workout, to have the muscle mass available.

1m6l36r,[DD] The Value Play Cycle Needs Its Third: Why I'm Betting on DNUT,2684,955,"Alright degenerates, we need to talk. OPEN ripped. KSS followed. But these cycles always come in threes, and we're missing the final piece.

**""History doesn't repeat but it does rhyme""** \- so what's the next verse?

I think it's DNUT. But if you've got a better idea, drop it in the comments. Here's my case:

# The Setup: OPEN your ahole and KSS DNUTz

Yeah, I went there. But while everyone's drunk on the first two gains, there's a $560M market cap company trading at bankruptcy multiples despite growing revenue.

**Current Price: $3.58**  
**Market Cap: $560M**  
**My Target: $8-12**

Show me another 2-3x opportunity this obvious.

# The Valuation Gap Is Insane

Look at these multiples and tell me this makes sense:

|Company|EV/EBITDA|EV/Sales|Context|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**DNUT**|**9.2x**|**1.2x**|Priced for bankruptcy despite growth|
|Starbucks|18.9x|3.57x|Premium coffee valuation|
|Restaurant Brands|17.0x|\~5x|Tim Hortons/BK parent|
|Dunkin' (2020 sale)|**23x**|N/A|What buyers actually pay for donuts|

Yet DNUT is:

* Operating **17,982 points of access globally**
* Posted 5% organic growth in FY2024
* Has one of the most recognized brands in food

Find me another company this disconnected from fundamentals.

# The Bear Cases Are All Weak

**""Ozempic will kill fast food""** \- I'm a fatass myself and there's no amount of Ozempic that removes my craving for hot, fresh donuts at 2am. Look at MCD and CMG at ATHs. People on Ozempic eat less, not never. A glazed donut is 190 calories of pure dopamine - that demand isn't disappearing.

**""The McDonald's deal ended!""** \- No, the TEST ended after rolling out to 2,400 stores. You think McDonald's spent millions on infrastructure for a 3-month trial? They're analyzing data. If it worked (spoiler: donuts + coffee = money), this goes nationwide.

**""They suspended the dividend!""** \- Good. They're investing in growth instead of paying boomers. That's exactly what you want in a turnaround.

# Three Ways This Plays Out

**Starting Point:**

* Stock: $3.58
* Market Cap: $560M
* Growing business with fixable issues

**Scenario 1: Modest Re-rate (12x EBITDA)**

Still way below peers:

* **Target: $8-9**
* **Return: 125-150%**

**Scenario 2: Industry Average (15x)**

If operations improve:

* **Target: $11-13**
* **Return: 200-250%**

**Scenario 3: Nothing Changes (10x)**

Status quo maintained:

* **Target: $5-6**
* **Return: 40-70%**

Even the bear case would be a healthy return on your money. Show me better risk/reward.

# Why The Setup Is Perfect

‚úì **Meme-able ticker** (DNUT - come on)  
‚úì **Small cap** ($560M = moves fast)  
‚úì **Value play** (half peer multiples)  
‚úì **Real business** (17,982 locations)  
‚úì **Catalyst rich** (McDonald's decision pending)  
‚úì **Acquisition target** (at these multiples) ‚úì **Options flow confirming** (Huge call buying at $5 strike)

# Recent ""Problems"" Are Actually Bullish

* **Q1 revenue down 1%** ‚Üí They sold Insomnia Cookies (portfolio cleanup)
* **Dividend suspended** ‚Üí More cash for growth/turnaround
* **McDonald's test ""ended""** ‚Üí Infrastructure built, awaiting expansion
* **Debt concerns** ‚Üí Manageable at 5x EBITDA, becomes nothing if margins improve

Every QSR turnaround story looks exactly like this before the re-rate.

# But Here's Where I Need Your Input

I'm convinced DNUT is the third play because:

1. **Valuation** \- It's the most undervalued name I can find
2. **Size** \- Small enough to move like OPEN and KSS did
3. **Catalysts** \- McDonald's decision, margin improvements, M&A potential
4. **Meme factor** \- The ticker alone guarantees viral potential
5. **Options flow** \- Big money is already positioning

But maybe I'm missing something. What else fits the pattern?

* Under $1B market cap?
* Trading at distressed multiples?
* Has clear catalysts ahead?
* Meme-able enough for WSB?
* Seeing unusual options activity?

Drop your picks below. But until someone shows me better risk/reward than 7:1 upside, I'm loading DNUT.

# Someone's Already Loading - Check the Options Flow

Here's what really got my attention: MASSIVE call buying the past few days, absolutely exploding today. The $5 strikes are getting hammered with volume.

Someone with deep pockets is betting big on a move above $5. That's a 40% move from here, and they're paying premium for it. When smart money moves this aggressively on a small cap, you pay attention.

This isn't retail buying weeklies. This is institutional-sized flow betting on a re-rate.

[past week](https://preview.redd.it/xcxfleepngef1.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69b385edf49636702af95a44e47b6c3d3038751)

[today](https://preview.redd.it/1od3hcy7qgef1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af667fdfc86245bc643c1a068a79688b06447dd)

# The Play

The options market is telling you something. When you see this kind of call buying on a beaten-down small cap with clear catalysts, it usually means someone knows something.

Those $5 calls? If DNUT hits just the LOW end of fair value ($8), those are 10-15x. If it hits $12? Those calls print harder than JPow in 2020.

I like the 11/21 $5 call. IV is only at 87% and volume is sufficient at 2k+

https://preview.redd.it/9lghn7dwqgef1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f654e56abef9da84cf86b0b6c83fa3e7757b2

**My Position:**

https://preview.redd.it/s2v1a859sgef1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c006ba69e418e6820ad3344bd8773fd44756bc9

The first two already ran. Don't be late to the third.

Because when McDonald's announces the national rollout, when margins tick up even 100bps, when some PE firm offers 15x EBITDA - this thing gaps to $8+ overnight.

Every distressed QSR (finance bro speak for fast food) that fixed itself got bought:

* Dunkin': 23x EBITDA to Inspire Brands
* Panera: Bought by JAB
* Popeyes: Acquired by RBI
* Buffalo Wild Wings: Taken private by Roark

At current multiples, DNUT is a sitting duck.

The cycle comes in threes:  
OPEN ‚úì  
KSS ‚úì  
???

I say DNUT. The options flow says DNUT. Prove us wrong.

Edit: position update as of 7/23 12:22am (since I keep getting asked for it). I didn't dump on you. Also, as a warning: DO NOT buy afterhours. That shit is too low volume. Just wait til the morning and get a better price

	‚Ä¢	~17M users
	‚Ä¢	Barely profitable
	‚Ä¢	Struggling to expand outside the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	No real global moat

Now $BULL in 2025 has:

	‚Ä¢	Over 24M users
	‚Ä¢	Funded accounts growing 10% YoY
	‚Ä¢	Customer assets up 45%
	‚Ä¢	Profitable (GAAP!)
	‚Ä¢	Dominant in LATAM & Asia
	‚Ä¢	Crypto ramping up again in the U.S.
	‚Ä¢	Real infrastructure, real monetization, real scale

And people are still doubting it?

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy: Robinhood IPO‚Äôd in 2021. Webull‚Äôs public debut happened in 2024. 

We‚Äôre comparing the same point in time and already, Webull has surpassed HOOD in almost every meaningful metric.

I get the hesitation: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Chinese.‚Äù
Sure, but so is TikTok. That didn‚Äôt stop it from eating Silicon Valley alive. And Webull‚Äôs U.S. operations are FINRA & SEC regulated. Your money and data stay in U.S. custody. It‚Äôs legit.

This is a second chance at Robinhood, but this time global, better run, and earlier in the cycle.

I‚Äôm not here to convince anyone who still needs ‚Äúmore confirmation.‚Äù

I‚Äôm here for the ones who want to catch the next wave before CNBC mentions it.

You want generational plays?
This is one.

PS:

I‚Äôll be real with you. Robinhood is better in many ways bigger brand, bigger cultural footprint, and it hit the market at the perfect time. I‚Äôm not denying that. But here‚Äôs the thing: if Webull simply reaches half of what Robinhood became in terms of adoption and market presence  just half  we‚Äôre talking about a $50 stock, minimum. And based on the fundamentals? That‚Äôs not some delusional moonshot ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reasonable trajectory

70x 1/16/26 $3 puts at .08 average.

(sections so even the smooth-brained among us can follow)

‚∏ª

1. FUNDAMENTALS (aka THE ROTTED CORE)
Innovative Beverage Group, formerly known as Innovative Beverage Group, sold energy drinks. 

They reverse-split 200-for-1, labeled them ‚ÄúQuantum Computing,‚Äù and never looked back. Their market cap is hovering at $3 B, with trailing twelve-month sales of $370 K. 

That‚Äôs ~$8K of valuation for every $1 of revenue. 

They‚Äôve seen a ~1,500 % YTD increase due to weekly call junkies forcing dealers to chase it higher.

‚∏ª

2. REVENUE (LOL)

Last quarter they reported $39,000 in sales.
Perspective: I make more than that behind my Wendy‚Äôs every six days (I‚Äôm busy)

No recurring contracts, no legit customers, just one-off ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù invoices. Although they did an unreal job of pumping over a 25k non recurring order from nasa.

‚∏ª

3. LEADERSHIP & TURNOVER (REVOLVING DOOR SUPREME)

CEO Dr. William McGann ‚Äúretired‚Äù after ~15 months (May ‚Äô25). Now the interim is the head lab professor‚Äîzero public-company ops history.

CFO seat already on its third backside this year. Latest guy came out of a SPAC that never made it to daylight‚Äî no one wants to sign their financials for too long. 

Board insiders collectively own pocket change; they live on stock they dump every time a shelf registration goes active.

‚∏ª

4. TECHNICALS

Everyone on Twitter is all bulled up over a bull flag, but it‚Äôs lost the 20 day, and is looking more tippy to me‚Ä¶ will be invalidated over 20 reclaim. 

‚∏ª

5. EARNINGS / CASH (NOT AS RICH AS THEY TELL YOU)
They brag about ‚Äústrong cash‚Äù: ~$350 M after two equity raises this year.

That pile exists ONLY because the share price is absurd; an ATM faucet grinding 24/7.

Burn rate ~$25‚Äì30 M a year before they scale hardware, so if the share price dumps the cash dies a slow death anyway.

Q1 ‚Äúincome‚Äù was a pure non-cash warrant liability gain‚Äîmasking an ~$8 M operating loss.

‚∏ª

6. ASSETS & LIABILITIES (WHAT‚ÄôS REALLY THERE)

		
Cash: 350 mm that we spoke of

Property and equipment: 8 mm lab equipment. So probably like 2 million laser pointers and a few raspberry pis to do gimmicky tricks with. Ooo quantum wow cooool 

Intangibles: 9 M so non peer reviewed patents and some nonsense

Goodwill: 55m accounting tricks from acquiring Qphoton or whatever.  

Liabilities: mostly just recurring operating expenses -22m. They did do a good job recently using equity to pay down debt. 

So: remove the raise cash and you own a garage lab and a stack of patent PDFs for 

‚∏ª

7. RESEARCH QUALITY (WHITE-PAPER SCENTED TOILET PAPER)

QRNG flyer ‚Äì real physics, zero raw data.

Land-mine vibrometer ‚Äì 100-nm vibration claim, but no confusion matrix, no ROC curve, nada. (Wow vibrating the land very hot)

Space-logistics arXiv ‚Äì cool equations, all simulated, not a single runtime on real gear.

None are peer-reviewed; all read like brochures.

8. ‚ÄúCOMPARABLES‚Äù JUST TO SHOW HOW NUTS THIS IS

Ticker	Rev (TTM)	Mkt Cap	P/S
QUBT	$0.37 M	$3 B	8,000√ó

1m64ba8,NVDA will see a massive correction as the ai bubble pops,3,177,"Everyone and their mom thinks AI will replace humans, send us to the nearest star, and grant us immortalityall within the next five years. I can't even scroll online without seeing the word ""AI."" AI this, AI that. But here's what I've learned from the crypto and NFT crazes: when everyone thinks something will change the world, it usually goes the exact opposite direction.

I expect a **massive spike up in NVDA** after the Fed lowers rates, but give it a year or two max, and reality is going to hit us like a freight train, bro. **AI is the most massive bubble we have ever seen**, and the reckoning will be worse than the housing market crash. Here are my main reasons why:

1. **AI is the greatest illusion of our time.** I've used ChatGPT plenty. It's great at generating word salad and generic code, but when it comes to doing **ACTUAL work** or fixing real problems, it just gives you more word salad instead of solutions. They claim AI can pass the hardest math tests? Sure, it can, because they've already fed it the answers. Try this: go to ChatGPT or any AI model and give it five documents with daily returns for five stocks. Ask it to generate a table showing each company's return for every six-month interval. All models will fail. Not only would it take ages, but it would require running Python code to even attempt it, instead of just giving you the direct answer.
2. **The biggest players in the industry CEOs, VCs, investment fund heads who are throwing the most money around have zero technical skills and absolutely no idea how LLMs actually work.** They're either straight-up lying to pump up their stocks, or they're genuinely retarded, thinking something that runs on a Mac Studio is intelligent or anything close to that. CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!
3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, ""BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,"" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!
4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.
5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising ""agentic AI models"" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.
6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?
7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always ""one year away.""
8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**
9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption.",1753157227.0

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA‚Äôs quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

‚ÄúOn export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.‚Äù

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: ‚ÄúTotal revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.‚Äù  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience ‚Äúmodest growth‚Äù due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion).¬†

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, ‚ÄúStrong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.‚Äù The gaming beat helped NVDA‚Äôs headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as ‚Äúregular‚Äù Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA‚Äôs company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%.¬†

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company‚Äôs share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1.¬†

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.¬†  


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst‚Äôs expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus.¬†

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call.¬†

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it‚Äôs not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the ‚Äústart of the new wave‚Äù Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year.¬†

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3.¬†

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term.¬†

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3‚Äôs forecast.¬†

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages.¬†

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2‚Äôs report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30.¬†

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year.¬†

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA‚Äôs history.¬†

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets.¬†

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn‚Äôt until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively.¬†

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA‚Äôs growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts.¬†

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.¬†

1m5wzb0,$51K on RKT Calls‚Ä¶ the next OPEN?,144,75,"Although haters will say OPEN is just a meme stock, the truth is there is a legit underlying fundamental turnaround story that has investors/traders excited:  

Lower interest rates are coming soon and the single family home market should see a dramatic increase in transaction volume.

This macroeconomic tailwind should also benefit RKT, which in the opinion of some, is now the Amazon of the single family space:  a one-stop shop with services including home search, buying, title and closing, loan origination and loan servicing.

Why I‚Äôm bullish on RKT in no particular order:

- Interest rate tailwinds

- Dan Gilbert, founder of RKT, has his shares locked up until June 30, 2026.  He owns NONE of the current Float.

- Valueact Capital, one of the most renowned hedge funds of all time, owns 7.8% of RKT Float.  ValueAct has been historically known as an activist shareholder that has consistently added value to many of the companies it has taken activist positions in the past.

- The cost savings and synergies from the recent acquisitions of Redfin and Mr. Cooper have not flowed through yet meaningfully for RKT earnings.  These combined savings and synergies are estimated to be at least $700 million per year.

- Short interest is 53% of Float

- Now that OPEN has seeped into the public consciousness, I predict all single family home-related stocks will now get more attention from investors.  RKT should be one of the main beneficiaries.

Galaxy Digital has all the ingredients for a massive run up.

1. Goldman Sachs Alum CEO Billionaire turned Crypto Wizard at the helm. Mike Novogratz.
2. Already massive BTC treasury. 7th in the world and growing.

3. Uniquely diversified crypto mine turned Ai Datacenter already leased out for 1 billion a year

4. Some genius on twitter purchased Satellite photos - which have all but confirmed that they are developing the adjacent HELIOS sites into more Ai datacenters. More data centers = potential for billions in additional revenue.

INCREASED power capacity at their Ai datacenters was applied for way back in 2022 - This puts them well ahead of the Ai rush. Giving them first mover. Assuming approval

Here's a value creation opportunity report. Assuming approval of max load/supply, it would add $42B in enterprise value in their datacenter business **alone**

4. FIRST earnings report coming up, they just moved it to August 5th, at 8:30 AM. Very positive sign that they are going to beat and/or have major announcements.

5. Their crypto business is on fire. Everything Novo touches turns to gold: [https://chainbroker.io/funds/galaxy-digital/](https://chainbroker.io/funds/galaxy-digital/)

6. investors are in such a rush to hop on the novo train that their most recent venture funding round was oversubscribed: [https://www.galaxy.com/newsroom/galaxy-announces-final-close-of-galaxy-ventures-fund-i](https://www.galaxy.com/newsroom/galaxy-announces-final-close-of-galaxy-ventures-fund-i)

7. They are a large participant in MM activity. A Satoshi era bitcoin wallet  moved 40k bitcoin and sent shockwaves through the market. You can't just sell that much bitcoin. Guess where they sent it to have it managed and offloaded? That's right. $GLXY

[https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whale-moves-last-btc-galaxy-digital](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whale-moves-last-btc-galaxy-digital)

Yes. This man is so trusted that funds literally send him billions.

My last point:

There's a very obvious crypto hype cycle going on right now. IF ANYTHING, we will see movement just based on that.

I've never been so sure of anything in my life.

Positions: - 100 GLXY 27.5 calls Expiring August 15th.

And before anyone says ""Why now"" ""You're just pumping to offload your position""

Check my post history. I've been telling everyone for months.

Happy trading!

**The Thesis:**¬†The reduction of rural medical services and staffing issues puts Telemedicine as a priority need in healthcare. I waited weeks for my appointment with my primary, but I was seen immediately with Teladoc. We use TDOC at my work since it's a traveling job installing POS systems, so I was immediately turned on to using it as it has saved my ass multiple times. Also, Aunt Cathy sold, so there is a play here. We didn't want her in this stock getting us cucked anyway.

**The Sauce:**¬†TDOC is a major buying opportunity with January 29 being the sparking catalyst to turn this into a bullrun with ER. The opportunity also is with Wellbound, Catapult, Uplift acquisition, and AI implementation paving the way here. Wellbound's EAP Launch this month targets a high-growth market, the Catapult acquisition ($65M) bolsters chronic care, lifting revenue. The acquisition of BetterHelp is showing signs of stabilization and we are seeing strong Integrated Care growth (example 3.3% in Q1) The $30M Uplift Acquisition adds $40M in annual sales.

**Valuation:**¬†In the NEAR TERM, GuruFocus has $18.68 DCF (major upside) and TDOC's P/S of 0.56 versus peers screams undervaluation. Analysts like Piper Sandler upgraded TDOC to buy. I know we don't give a damn about analysts, but it helps the stock so I threw it in here.

**\*\*\*\* I currently hold 66 call options on Teladoc Health (TDOC) at a $10 strike, expiring January 16, 2026**. Basically my 66 calls right now target $109K Base or $203K high case with AI setting the stage for the moonshot. Below is the math.

Updated Stock Price Forecasts for January 2026 Adjusting prior forecasts ($18.20/$27.79/$41.94) for the $8.05 Friday close, Wellbound, Catapult, and multiple analyst ""Buy"" upgrade:

\*\*\* Revenue Growth: TTM revenue of $2.553B, with growth rates of 13% (low, factoring lawsuit/tariff risks), 18% (base, steady execution), and 22% (high, Wellbound/Catapult upside).

\* P/S Ratios: Current P/S is 0.56 ($1.416B √∑ $2.553B). Interpolated to Q1 2026:

‚Ä¢ Low: 0.56 + (1.5 - 0.56) √ó 0.5 = 1.03

‚Ä¢ Base: 0.56 + (2.5 - 0.56) √ó 0.5 = 1.53

‚Ä¢ High: 0.56 + (4.0 - 0.56) √ó 0.5 = 2.28

\* Revenue Projections (2 quarters):

‚Ä¢ Low: $2.553B √ó (1.0312)^(2)¬†‚âà $2.828B

‚Ä¢ Base: $2.553B √ó (1.0427)^(2)¬†‚âà $2.906B

‚Ä¢ High: $2.553B √ó (1.0513)^(2)¬†‚âà $2.954B

\* Market Cap:

‚Ä¢ Low: $2.828B √ó 1.03 ‚âà $2.912B

‚Ä¢ Base: $2.906B √ó 1.53 ‚âà $4.446B

‚Ä¢ High: $2.954B √ó 2.28 ‚âà $6.735B

\* Stock Price (√∑ 160M shares):

‚Ä¢ Low: $2.912B √∑ 160M ‚âà $18.20

‚Ä¢ Base: $4.446B √∑ 160M ‚âà $27.79

‚Ä¢ High: $6.735B √∑ 160M ‚âà $42.09

Monthly Stock Price Projections Linear growth from $8.05 (July 2025) to January 2026:

‚Ä¢ Low Case: Increase = $18.20 - $8.05 = $10.15; Monthly = $10.15 / 6 ‚âà $1.69

‚Ä¢ Base Case: Increase = $27.79 - $8.05 = $19.74; Monthly = $19.74 / 6 ‚âà $3.29

‚Ä¢ High Case: Increase = $42.09 - $8.05 = $34.04; Monthly = $34.04 / 6 ‚âà $5.67

Updated Profit Calculations on my current 66 calls:

Profit Formula: 6,600 √ó max(stock price - $10, 0) - $7,920

‚Ä¢ Low Scenario ($18.20):

Value per share: $18.20 - $10 = $8.20

Total value: 6,600 √ó $8.20 = $54,120

Profit: $54,120 - $7,920 = $46,200

‚Ä¢ Base Scenario ($27.79):

Value per share: $27.79 - $10 = $17.79

Total value: 6,600 √ó $17.79 = $117,414

Profit: $117,414 - $7,920 = $109,494

‚Ä¢ High Scenario ($42.09):

Value per share: $42.09 - $10 = $32.09

Total value: 6,600 √ó $32.09 = $211,794

Profit: $211,794 - $7,920 = $203,874

**YOLO Conclusion:**¬†TDOC is a bargain with Wellbound, Catapult, $30M UpLift Acquisition, the narrative for their AI integration, and 94 Million current users including myself (and everyone in my company). Citron Research in June 2023 conducted extensive research into TDOC and their conclusion was that TDOC is a coiled spring. I was early on my buy, but I am not wrong about the January strike. This is heading toward a $1.14T telemedicine market by 2032.

Crispr gene editing biotech with strong balance sheet and several readouts in 2nd half of 2025 and 1st half of 2026. Recently a director bought $50mil of stock, the largest  purchase in many years. And not just any director, the managing partner of SR One, the spinout of GSK‚Äôs corporate venture arm. This guy knows what he is doing. A few weeks ago he posted on linkedin about 3 portfolio companies of SR One closing $1B in pharma partnerships. He knows what pharma looks for. CRSP probably will not be an acquisition target given its size (based on JPM HC last year), but partnerships and selling off assets with more proof of concept is a very real possibility in my opinion. Maybe even acquisition given its game changing pipeline with more data.

CRSP has one approved treatment (Casgevy) that is ex vivo (meaning cells from patients are removed, edited using crispr, then reintroduced) for sickle cell. Stock has lagged due to slow rollout and brutal regimen to prepare to treatment. Treatment can only happen in certain centres. CEO has described casgevy as akin to genetic ‚Äúsurgery‚Äù.

The bright side is that in 2025 and 2026, there is estimated to be many more casgevy patients and its administration to increase. Revenue is only recognized once the edited cells are administered back into the body of the patient which can take up to 2 months from removal.

The real game changers are the in vivo therapies they are working on. In vivo, meaning it will edit the cells inside the body. They just got positive phase 1 results for one of their CVD therapies. More to come with readouts.

70% institutional ownership, went up 17% on Friday on director buy. Rock solid balance sheet. More readouts soon. Revenue recognition will put it back on radar. Ready for prime time. Lots of upside.

The study analyzes the profitability of a simple **5-minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** strategy on the **QQQ ETF** from **2016 to 2023**. Some key takeaways:

* Without leverage, the strategy allegedly produced **33% annualized alpha** net of commissions, outperforming passive QQQ investing.
* With **3√ó leverage (TQQQ)**, it claims a **total return of 1,484%**, compared to **169% for passive QQQ** over the same period.
* It uses tight stop-losses and takes trades only in the direction of the initial move.

While it sounds impressive on paper, I‚Äôm curious how realistic this is when accounting for **slippage**, **fill quality**, **reset mechanics of leveraged ETFs**, and **real trading costs**. Also, it‚Äôs based on one ticker during a very bullish time frame.

Has anyone tried replicating this or trading similar ORB strategies live?

Would love to hear:

* Anyone's experience with intraday ORB strategies?
* Thoughts on the study's assumptions (e.g., daily compounding with TQQQ)?
* Do you think this kind of edge is sustainable, or just backtest overfit?

Was out in the Grand Tetons dodging bears and overpriced bison burgers this week when I saw a local Wyoming news story on Ramaco Resources $METC. They just opened the Brook Mine on July 11 2025. First new rare earth mine in the US in over 70 years

CEO was on the news talking about how their rare earth deposit is easier to access than $MP. Said the material is in softer ground and they‚Äôre going to do processing onsite instead of shipping it overseas

He even compared it directly to $MP which already has deals with Apple and the DOD. That‚Äôs the kind of narrative that made $MP rip. And now the Pentagon is sniffing around Wyoming too

Meanwhile $METC is a coal company that already has strong cash flow. They‚Äôre not some cash burning startup hoping to maybe dig a hole. They‚Äôre mining now and using profits to fund this rare earth pivot

Stock is around $22 with a market cap just over $1B so it barely qualifies for WSB. It popped \~30 percent on the mine news but hasn‚Äôt gone full rocket mode yet. Low float. High volatility. RSI is hitting 96 levels right now

If this turns into even half of what $MP did it could run hard. Especially if they land a supply deal or anything that smells like national security. We‚Äôre in a tariff world and the US wants its own supply chain

**TLDR**  
Was sightseeing bears in Wyoming and found $METC. First US rare earth mine in 70 years. Cheaper to extract. Onsite processing. Pentagon is interested. $MP 2.0 loading

1m4qe6q,Why ABCL is my highest conviction position,256,98,"I'm up >50% on ABCL since buying in last year, and I'm not even close to considering selling. ABCL jumped nearly 15% last Friday alone (pic related), so the takeoff may already be in progress. I see >100$ a share by end of 2026. Here's why I see this happening:

* ABCL does two things - it discovers drugs for major pharma companies and startups, and it also discovers its own drugs. To date, it has discovered more than 100 potential drugs for other companies. For confidentiality reasons it can't disclose what all these are, but they're out there, and when some of them get approval, they will start generating cash. These aren't partnerships with no name companies, but rather Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Regeneron, Novartis. The big boys. Usually, biotech companies get one kick at the can with one drug. ABCL is playing the numbers game. If they think a drug is too juicy to discover for someone else, they do it for themselves, and then they own the whole thing. They have two of their own drugs in clinical trials, and when they start generating results soon, the price is going to move big time.
* ABCL got its ass kicked by a bad biotech market over the last few years, but there are signs that the winter is ending. The bounce back is going to be swift and aggressive. ABCL is well positioned to capitalize on this bounce relative to the rest of the industry because they have almost $1B in cash. Read that again. This company is trading at 1.5x cash value. Most other biotechs their size are down to their last pennies right now. The last time there was a good biotech market, the stock traded at $50.
* AI is revitalizing the industry. Think about AI models for biology like AlphaFold, and then think about what AI focused companies like ABCL are cooking up for their eyes only. This isn't hype, the AlphaFold actually solved the protein folding problem. Industry insiders are saying ""we could cure all disease with these models"". Maybe that part is hype, but even improving drug discovery efficiency by a small amount is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Because ABCL has done 100+ programs, it has the data to do AI better than anyone.
* Doing these programs also let them build expertise that they can no apply to their own programs. You're buying into the platform, technology, and expertise, unlike most companies in this space where you're buying into their particular drug candidate. 
* Their CEO. Watch him and decide for yourself:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8q\_qZgqSRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8q_qZgqSRw)
* If you needed any more reason to believe, Shkreli says it's a buy:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd12vd6hBwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd12vd6hBwc)
* Peter Thiel was also an early investor. He left the board, but still holds a shit ton of shares.

It is still biotech, so it's far from a sure thing and could go tits up if their current drugs in clinical trials are failures. But the upside here is insane, which is why I'm holding until at least $100. Despite the recent strong performance, we're nowhere near seeing the potential of how high this can go. ",1753021984.0

Value Proposition: SBET is raising $5 billion to buy ETH, holding 280,706 ETH ($840M at $3,000/ETH) and purchasing ~14,931 ETH/day. They could complete their target by December 2025, owning ~1.67M ETH.

ETH Price Catalyst: when ETH hits $8,000 by year-end (bear case imo), SBET‚Äôs holdings would be worth $13.34 billion. With a market-to-net-asset-value (mNAV) of 2, SBET‚Äôs market cap could reach $26.68 billion, it‚Äôs currently at <$2b

Price Targets;

  - Bullish: $666/share (50M shares, mNAV 2.5).

Why It Fits WSB: SBET offers crypto exposure without blockchain hassle, with potential for massive gains if ETH rallies. Volatility suits aggressive investors.

Risks: Share dilution from the $5 billion raise and ETH price volatility could lower returns (bear case: $62/share at ETH $5,000).

1m46fuj,Google‚Äôs AI Awakening: Earnings Bull Case,296,155,"# Beyond the AI hype, YouTube's dominance and a transforming Search business create a powerful, and potentially undervalued, growth story.

As Nvidia Corp. solidifies its position as a $4 trillion titan on the back of the AI hardware boom, a compelling debate is intensifying on Wall Street over what some see as a glaring valuation gap: Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.

While shares of the search giant have performed well, they have lagged the explosive, triple-digit gains of the companies building the ""picks and shovels"" of the AI revolution. This has led to a growing belief among some investors that Google, with its deeply integrated ""full stack"" of AI assets, is on the cusp of a significant re-rating. They are betting that the company‚Äôs upcoming second-quarter earnings report on July 23 will be the primary catalyst, forcing the market to shift its focus from the cost of Google's AI ambitions to the reality of its profits.

‚ÄúFor years, AI was a massive cost center for Google. The question for the second half of 2025 is whether it can become a massive profit center,‚Äù says one technology strategist. ‚ÄúNext week‚Äôs report is the first real test of that thesis.‚Äù

# The Unseen Competitor Winning the Streaming Wars

While investors have been fixated on Google's AI story, the recent earnings report from Netflix provided an inadvertent, and powerful, bull case for one of Google‚Äôs most valuable assets: YouTube.

Netflix‚Äôs management noted the intense competition for viewer engagement, and recent Nielsen data tells the story. In May, YouTube commanded 12.5% of all U.S. television screen time, significantly ahead of Netflix‚Äôs 7.5%. This data confirms that YouTube is not just a mobile video app, but the dominant media platform in the modern living room.

Financially, the scale is staggering. YouTube‚Äôs advertising revenue alone, at over $34 billion annually, is nearly the size of Netflix‚Äôs entire global enterprise. When combined with an estimated $19 billion in subscription revenue from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, a hypothetical standalone ‚ÄúYouTube Inc.‚Äù would be a media behemoth with over $53 billion in annual sales, far outpacing its rivals.

‚ÄúNetflix‚Äôs earnings call was inadvertently the best bull case for YouTube we‚Äôve seen all year,‚Äù noted one portfolio manager. ‚ÄúIt confirmed who truly owns the living room, and that value has yet to be fully unlocked in Alphabet‚Äôs stock price.‚Äù

# The Bear Case Reimagined: Search as an AI Utility

A persistent fear among investors has been that AI chatbots would cannibalize Google‚Äôs core Search business, which remains its primary source of profit. A contrarian view is now emerging, however, that AI will not be a threat, but rather Search's greatest accelerator.

This thesis posits that as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents become more prevalent, they will need constant access to the live, indexed web to provide up-to-date, reliable information. The most efficient and trusted source for that data is Google's Search index.

Under this model, the biggest new customers for Google Search may not be humans, but other AIs. This could transform the Search business from a consumer-facing advertising platform into a foundational ‚ÄúSearch as a Service‚Äù utility for the entire AI economy, monetized through high-margin, programmatic API access.

‚ÄúThe fear was that the search box would die,‚Äù says a tech strategist. ‚ÄúThe reality may be that the underlying Search index becomes the foundational data layer for the entire AI ecosystem‚Äîa far more valuable position.‚Äù

# The Path to $3 Trillion

For Google to close the valuation gap with its peers, investors believe the market must recognize the value of its interconnected empire. A ""sum-of-the-parts"" analysis reveals immense potential: a dominant media company in YouTube, a profitable and growing Cloud business, and a portfolio of high-risk, high-reward ""Other Bets"" like the autonomous driving unit, Waymo.

The ultimate validation of its AI leadership could come from a partnership with its biggest rival. Persistent rumors of Apple integrating Google's Gemini into iOS for advanced AI tasks draw a direct parallel to the estimated $20 billion annual deal Google pays Apple for its search default status. Such a deal would instantly cement Gemini's position as the indispensable intelligence layer for the mobile world.

The narrative for the past year has rightfully celebrated the companies building the infrastructure for AI. The bull case for Google is a bet that the focus is about to shift to the companies that can most effectively monetize it. Investors will be watching closely on July 23rd for the answer.

  
**TL;DR:**

* **Google is likely undervalued.** The market has rewarded AI hardware companies like Nvidia but hasn't yet priced in Google's ability to profit from its ""full-stack"" AI ecosystem. The July 23rd earnings report is the key catalyst to prove this.
* **YouTube is quietly winning the streaming wars.** It has more viewing time than Netflix, making it a dominant media empire whose massive value is not fully reflected in Google's stock price.
* **The ""AI is a threat to Search"" narrative is likely wrong.** The opposite is more probable: AI agents will become massive new customers, using the Google Search index as the essential data layer for the entire AI economy, creating a new, high-margin business.
* **For the first time, real revenue from AI subscriptions (Gemini, Veo) will be reported.** This shifts the story from ""AI is an expense"" to ""AI is a profit engine.""
* **A potential multi-billion dollar deal for Apple to use Gemini** (similar to their current Search deal) is a massive, often overlooked catalyst that would cement Google's AI supremacy.

1m3z9k9,Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish files to go public on NYSE,305,95,"The Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish filed for an IPO on Friday, the latest digital asset firm to head for the public market.  
  
The company, led by CEO Tom Farley, a veteran of the finance industry and former president of the New York Stock Exchange, said it plans to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúBLSH.‚Äù  
  
A spinout of [Block.one](http://Block.one), Bullish started with an initial investment from backers including Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund and Thiel Capital, along with Nomura, Mike Novogratz and others. Bullish acquired crypto news site CoinDesk in 2023.  
  
‚ÄúIn the first quarter of 2025, Bullish exchange executed over $2.5 billion in average daily volume, ranking in the top five exchanges by spot volume for Bitcoin and Ether,‚Äù the company said on its website. The prospectus listed top competitors as Binance, Coinbase  
¬†and Kraken.  
  
The IPO filing says that as of March 31, the total trading volume since launch has exceeded $1.25 trillion.  
  
The filing is another significant step for the cryptocurrency industry, which has fought for years to convince institutions to embrace digital assets as legitimate investments.  
  
It‚Äôs already been a big year on the market for crypto offerings, highlighted by stablecoin issuer Circle, which has jumped more than sevenfold since its IPO in June. Etoro, an online trading platform that includes services for crypto investors, debuted in May.  
  
Novogratz‚Äôs crypto firm Galaxy Digital started trading on the Nasdaq in May, moving its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange. And in June, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custodian founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, confidentially filed for an IPO in the U.S.  
  
Meanwhile, investors continue to flock to bitcoin. The digital currency is trading at over $117,000, up from about $94,000 at the start of the year.  
  
President Donald Trump, on Friday, signed the GENIUS Act into law -- a set of regulations that establish some initial consumer protections around stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar with the intent of reducing price volatility associated with many cryptocurrencies.  
  
In its filing with the SEC, Bullish says its mission is partly to ‚Äúdrive the adoption of stablecoins, digital assets, and blockchain technology.‚Äù  
  
Crypto industry players, including Thiel, Elon Musk, and President Trump‚Äôs AI and Crypto czar David Sacks spent heavily to re-elect Trump and have pushed for legislation that legitimizes digital assets and exchanges.

Position: Scaling into 1,000+ shares 
Conviction: Stronger than the LT4 torque curve
Catalyst: IP dominance in AI memory infrastructure nobody‚Äôs pricing in

üèéÔ∏è The Setup:

I sold my 2019 Sebring Orange Z06 ‚Äî 2LZ, Kalahari interior, 5,955 miles of pure sauce ‚Äî for $78K cash.

Why?

Because while everyone‚Äôs chasing gains in NVDA, AMD, and MU, I went full galaxy brain and bought the company that quietly gets paid every time those companies scale.

I didn‚Äôt just trade torque for tech.
I traded a car for compoundable alpha.



üß† What is Rambus (RMBS)?
	‚Ä¢	NOT a RAM company, it‚Äôs the patent-powered IP tollbooth for AI memory.
	‚Ä¢	Their tech fuels DDR5, HBM3, PCIe, and CXL ‚Äî aka every AI/data center ramp in progress.
	‚Ä¢	Licensing model = 80% gross margins, no debt, $500M cash, printing risk-free cash every quarter.
	‚Ä¢	No manufacturing risk, just collecting checks like a chip landlord.



üî• Technical Breakout Confirmed
	‚Ä¢	Cleared a cup-with-handle base at $63.15, broke out hard and is now pushing toward ATHs near $69‚Äì70.
	‚Ä¢	Riding above 21- and 50-day moving averages like it‚Äôs on magnetic rails.
	‚Ä¢	Relative Strength: 87
	‚Ä¢	IBD Composite Rating: 96
	‚Ä¢	EPS Rating: 99

üìâ Every technical signal says:
This thing wants to fly.

üíº Who‚Äôs Buying?

Institutions are already ahead of you:

Fund	Value Held	     Trend
BlackRock	$1.18B	      ‚Üë Increasing
Vanguard	$644M	‚Üë Increasing
T. Rowe Price	$453M	‚Üë Increasing
Invesco	$234M	       ‚Üë Increasing
Janus, Mariner, Signaturefd	+$113M in July	Just entered

Even IBD just lumped RMBS in with NVDA and AVGO on their elite ‚Äúfunds are loading‚Äù list. This ain‚Äôt some rando tech penny ‚Äî this is the next chapter of AI infrastructure.



üìÜ What‚Äôs Next?
	1.	Q2 Earnings ‚Äì July 28
	‚Ä¢	Expected: $0.58 EPS / $167M revenue
	‚Ä¢	Rambus always sandbags. Beat + raise incoming.
	2.	AI build-out tailwind
	‚Ä¢	DDR5, HBM3, CXL adoption means licensing revenue spikes.
	‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre in every next-gen memory and PCIe lane that matters.
	3.	Price Targets
	‚Ä¢	Analyst Median: $71
	‚Ä¢	Top End: $90+
	‚Ä¢	My PT: 3-digit club.
Because IP + AI = asymmetry.



üöÄ Why I‚Äôm All-In:
	‚Ä¢	Most traders buy what CNBC tells them. I buy what CNBC will eventually discover.
	‚Ä¢	NVDA gets headlines. RMBS gets checks.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not swinging for a 10% gain. I‚Äôm leveraging intellectual property in a vertical that can‚Äôt function without it.

You can keep your car. I‚Äôll take the cash flow.
The Corvette was fast‚Ä¶ but RMBS moves in compound interest. üíµüìà

TL;DR: You‚Äôre paying **cash value for an FDA-approved CNS-penetrant lung-cancer pill with 80 % margins**, **$660 M of liquidity** (2y run away), an **NCCN ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô tag** and the only biotech CEO who has already turned a single TKI into a $14 B exit‚Äîupside multiples range from 3√ó on execution to 10√ó on a take-out.

Why you, your wife, her lover should be investing in NUVB?  
**Nuvation Bio Inc.** is a clinical-stage biotechnology company based in the US. It's focus? **Oncology.**  
If you are like me, you probably didn't know what oncology was but in regard language they are just focusing on cancer studies.

When I say BIOtech you say? ""Which phase are we at for which drug""?  
\- talectrectinib (aka IBTROZI for the friends and family) just received full FDA approval (June 11 2025) for ROS1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Market reaction? Decent $NUVB grew by \~30% since then

And you know what's amazing? NUVB **trades around the low-single-digit dollar range** and currently has a market capitalisation of roughly **US $600 million**. I know, I know what a tiny one it is but she told me it's not the size that matters so we fine.

So we know that it trades at an historical low even after the run up post FDA so why the fuck should we invest in that shit?  
Incredible leadership. I mean look at this guy:

[David T Hung, CEO of NUVB](https://preview.redd.it/v7v95xljoodf1.png?width=248&format=png&auto=webp&s=6438b90616473c76a5018bffa9e51a57155a5691)

This isn't this guy first rodeo, he has been through it he previously built and sold Medivation (XTANDI¬Æ) to Pfizer even after a rough patch because of their phase 3 failure he was able to turn things around and bring a whopping 20x for its investors.

Not convinced yet? Look at the damn [CFO](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/philippe-sauvage). Yes he looks like a regard but he is a regard that been through it and his fucking name is Philippe Sauvage. Fuck if James Bond vilain doesn't make you want to invest, I don't know what will.

Hedge funds are in it too, BlackRock increased its position

**Competition**? 18 Jun 2025 NCCN update places IBTROZI as a **Preferred option in every treatment line** and **explicitly for brain mets & post-crizotinib resistance**.

Balance sheet?

\- **$462 M cash** (Mar-25).  
\- **$200 M Sagard royalty + debt** already drawn  
**- Zero use of the $200 M ATM to date.**

They can expand without any foreseable dillution.

Key events?

**-** Early shipments start July-25 (triggers $50 M Sagard tranche).  
**-** Q2 call 6 Aug-25 ‚Äì first script numbers & 2025 guidance.  
**-** WCLC Sept + ESMO Oct ‚Äì long-term CNS & RWE data.  
\- Japan approval decision Dec-25.

The play?

Bought some long dated options but have been increasing my shares positions in my account that has not been restricted to penny stock.

Based on current volume and trend we could be sitting between $3-4 next week, you know, next week when we will have avoided delisting from the Nas due to being below the minimum bid price.

The federal government has a initiative called the **Defense Authorization for Strategic and High‚ÄëTech.**¬†Speaking in terms of minerals initiative‚Äîit presents as an¬†**investment/funding program**¬†linked to the DoD (and also relevant to DPA, DOE) aimed at accelerating U.S. supply chains in critical minerals (like graphite, rare earths, etc.). It focuses on¬†**grants, offtake agreements, and financial backing.**¬†They also have a dashboard called FAST-41. This is primarily for permitting and regulatory approvals related to infrastructure, including mining and critical minerals.

As we have seen with¬†[the recent MP <-> Pentagon deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html), the US government isn‚Äôt joking around about providing significant backing to promising rare earth and critical minerals companies that process, mine, and develop product domestically. They have¬†[outright said it themselves](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/pentagon-keep-working-with-us-rare-earths-projects-us-defense-official-says-2025-07-15/)¬†\- they are aiming to provide more funding, and fast.

We can use DASH and FAST-41 to our advantage to help us make investment choices as this run extends across the industry. I expect further DoD funding to trickle in within the next few weeks. Here are some compelling contenders for federal funding and incentivization, analyzed by their relationship with the federal government (existing contracts, speculation, FAST designation, or beyond).

>**UCORE Rare Metals (UURAF)**: Strategically placed with exposure to both US and Canadian government investments, this company has compelling technology for the separation of Heavy Rare Earths.¬†[They have recently been awarded a DoD grant](https://ucore.com/ucore-launches-us-department-of-defense-funded-18-4-million-commercial-rare-earth-refining-project/).

>**Energy Fuels (UUUU)**: As both a uranium producer and a producer of rare earth oxides¬†[(most recently announcing heavy rare earth oxide production)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-104500195.html), this company is well-poised for significant government investment.

>**American Battery Technology (ABAT)**: Leading in battery recycling, this company has relationships with big names like TESLA and ties to federal funds.

>**Graphite One (GPHOF):**¬†This company has the potential to be come a vertically integrated graphite source. China‚Äôs grip over graphite processing is equally as dominant as their grip over rare earth processing.

>**WestWater Resources (WWR):**¬†Also a graphite producer, this company is well-poised for support from Washington.¬†[Recently, the administration announced import tariffs on graphite anode from China.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-commerce-dept-sets-935-anti-dumping-tariff-chinese-anode-graphite-2025-07-17/#:~:text=July%2017%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,less%20than%20fair%20market%20value.)¬†That‚Äôs big news.

>**Lithium Americas (LAC):**¬†North America‚Äôs largest lithium deposit with big name partnerships¬†[(e.g. GM invested $650 million dollars into it](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Unlocking-Thacker-Pass-General-Motors-to-Contribute-Combined-625-Million-in-Cash-and-Letters-of-Credit-to-New-Joint-Venture-with-Lithium-Americas/default.aspx)). This one is as obvious a play as I have ever seen.

>**The Metals Company (TMC):**¬†High risk, high reward. They are awaiting permitting news in the next few months. Unprecedented plan to retrieve minerals from the ocean floor.

I also continue to believe in further upside at¬†**MP materials,**¬†despite their already magnificent run and news.

**II. Import Tariffs via Section 232**

In April, T[rump initiated a Section 232 investigation into the national security threat that critical minerals pose](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/).¬†[Likewise as with Copper,](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-50-tariff-copper-effective-august-1-2025-07-10/)¬†and as we have seen with Graphite just yesterday (linked above), we are likely to see tariffs roll out on further minerals by way of this investigation. After the report is completed, Trump will have a short amount of time to decide whether to impose tariffs or not on the industry.

Which minerals, though? Theoretically, most of them, as they all are strategic to defense. However, our production capacity is not high for certain areas yet (e.g. heavy rare earths), so what will happen exactly is not known to me entirely.

That being said, we know that the administration is not afraid of stepping up to China boldly, nor are they afraid of import controls and tariffs. This is an area to watch carefully. I expect announcements in the next weeks to months, if not sooner.

Lithium in particular stands out to me. Chinese price-gouging of the spot price has made it almost impossible for domestic producers to be able to compete. Take that information as you wish!

That‚Äôs all for now folks.

Extremely Bullish outlook could cook this play I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if a bullish outlook comes about.ALSO. 1 thing to keep in mind CLF is the first company to report earnings in the sector, with the idling and maintenance in a lot of the facilities could make the industry appear a lot cooler than it actually is. In the event steel sector follows suit from CLF earnings I would look on scooping up other companies before their earnings are reported. The earnings date will be pre August tariffs making me think stock falls at earnings and shoots back up around August Q3 and on. Sold my 2027 leaps because I‚Äôm convicted there will be a short term pull back. Do with this as you please.

Fast forward to today:¬†**it‚Äôs sitting at $54**,¬† and yet‚Ä¶nothing. No hype. No CNBC circle-jerk. Still under the radar, despite being one of the only real AI robotics plays outside of Amazon.¬†

2. $SYM has been stealth running. Not on FinTwit. Not on CNBC. Not even getting memed. This baby is unhyped AF, and that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm bullish.
3. They have $22 BILLION in backlog. Even if they signed¬†*zero*¬†new customers tomorrow (they will), they‚Äôre still printing robot money.
4. So far it‚Äôs only in the US. Their system is modular and scalable. Global expansion is inevitable. Imagine when this hits Europe or Asia and people realize robots don‚Äôt need visas or sleep.
5. Walmart is implementing ""dark stores,"" which are retail locations not open to the public, solely focused on fulfilling online orders, showing there is now a push towards efficiency and $$$.

(Author of https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/cqdUR3bHOm) I haven't  posted much except yolomuch because honestly I'm not funny anymore. And I had a gf who sucked my energy. Let me say a bored female is a very dangerous individual, they will invent games to alleviate boredom that ARE NOT FUN GAMES. I broke up with pookie bear and things became clear again. I noticed that  ethereum is giving pure heterosexual energy I've never seen before. How to capitalize? The company is BTBT.

BTBT is spinning of a AI HPC company called White Fiber (announced today). They also sold all their BTC to buy ETH and are committed to buying ETH similar to $MSTR to be a eth treasury. $ETH bull signal was announced when $HOOD revealed they were using it as their layer to tokenize assets in EU. Then Tom Lee joined ETH treasury BNMR to make it another MSTR. A few days ago it was revealed that Peter Theil (the owner of Washington) had a significant stake in BNMR so a big ETH bull. Institutions are also loading ETH and it's the most shorted in history, its use case validated by $HOOD and we have the crypto bill. ETH by tutes looking to get into tokenization/crypto because it has been validated over all other smart contract type tokens.

So, I'm entering on a leveraged ETH trade in essence. I believe to many things aligned for ETH not to blast through ATH. With my hope being that BTBT mkt cap hits the max BNMR mkt cap of 12b making it ~$40 a share. The AI angle doesn't hurt either.

Which means I am betting on a black swan type move by ETH and leveraged to bank on this shit my guy. I think people will chase especially tutes who had shit returns possible dump BTC to get on Etheruem returns because to me it's so obvious.

1m1qoqw,VKTX: Due diligence based on upcoming oral Phase 2 VK2735 data and a long term perspective.,172,172,"Hello everyone! This is the first DD that I am posting on Reddit.

I've not seen anyone really talking about VKTX in the daily threads or anywhere really, and I'm really surprised. The potential there is absolutely massive, and the risks are limited. Please note, this can be both played as a long term investment (the best way in my opinion) or as a swing trade based on upcoming oral data. I have been both investing and trading VKTX for a long time now, and I currently hold a long term position.

This DD will be long, but it has to be, because it's not a simple stock and it's not a simple industry either. This can however help us in a way, because less people and firms are interested in the stock (=the share price is being kept low, which we can use to our advantage). For your convenience, I have separated this DD in multiple subsections. The second one (valuation scenarios) will be what will interest most people, and the others will focus on introducing the company, the weight loss sector in addition to giving counterpoints to some bear theses I have seen.

\---------------------------------------------

# Soo.... What the hell is VKTX?

VKTX (Viking Therapeutics) is a \~$3.45B biotech company focused on weight loss and metabolic diseases. They have a few pipeline assets, but what really matters, and what this thesis is based on, is VK2735, their GLP-1/GIP dual agonist weight loss candidate.

VK2735 is being developed in both:

* Subcutaneous form (currently in Phase 3), and
* Oral form (currently at the end of Phase 2, with data likely between late July and early September 2025 by my projections)

By the way, this is the same mechanism of action as tirzepatide (Eli Lilly‚Äôs Mounjaro/Zepbound), meaning it hits the GLP-1 and GIP pathways for effects on weight loss, appetite suppression, and metabolic health, all-in-one. Dual GLP/GIP is the ''next-level'' of GLP drugs such as Wegovy/Ozempic. VKTX also owns an agent for MASH, VK2809, but management is fully focusing on VK2735 because that's where the money is, as will be shown in the next subsection of this DD.

To note, Q2 earnings will be on July 23, but they aren't really important. What could be interesting to note will be the current cash position, but that's kinda it.

\---------------------------------------------

# Valuation Scenarios

Let's get into the fun stuff. The obesity TAM in 2024 was almost 16B. What about in the future?

Here's what analyst firms think the TAM for the obesity market will be by the 2030s.

* 95B by 2030 (Goldman Sachs)
* 150B by 2030 (Morgan Stanley Research, 2025)
* 158B by 2032 (Leerink Partners)
* 150B by 2033 (BMO Capital Markets)

According to models from analysts at GoldmanSachs, LLY should capture a little less than 50% of the TAM by 2030. You can see this gives a lot of space to competition. Why not NVO? NVO had a decent product when it was the first and only option on the market, now... not so much. They are losing a ton of market share to LLY, which is why NVO's share price tanked so much in the recent months and wouldn't really be a great buy. Apart from LLY, NVO and VKTX, there's not really anyone else really. A few others such as AMGN or MTSR. Speaking of MTSR, I do think they are slightly overvalued, their pipeline is definitely not as strong as VKTX. It's not really that MTSR is overvalued compared to VKTX but more that VKTX is criminally undervalued. 

But yeah, there's definitely not a lot of competition in this space, which is why a potential best-in-class smaller cap player such as VKTX can easily capture a lot of the TAM.

For the following scenarios, I will use a very simplified method where the valuation is 4x the revenue. Is it a perfect method? No, but it's still a great method to use, especially considering I can't make this post 25 pages long.

**Base case:** we could see an approval by 2028, modest penetration of the market, which would be 5B revenue/year, at a 4x multiple, means a valuation of 20B or $180/share.

**Bull case:** if VKTX becomes one of the top 3 market leaders in weight loss, 15-20% market share = 10-15B revenue/year, again at a 4x multiple would be a valuation of 40-60B or $360-540/share. This is a very conservative estimate.

**Short term buyout case:** it could be a buyout at 100-200/share, depending on who would be the acquirer. My money would be on 150+ though. A subsection in this DD will focus on this scenario.

**Hopium case**, what we all love! Oral and subcutaneous would dominate the market, revenue would be between 30-60B/year which could be translated to a 120-240B valuation or a $1500-2500/share. The probability of such a scenario is of course very low, but that's what the hopium case is supposed to be.

**Bear case**, while unlikely, still needs to be mentioned because I want you to understand the risks of biotech. Bad (not subpar, but BAD) data would be needed, or a really abysmal safety profile (deaths), which would force management to scrap VK2725. PT in such a scenario could be around $10/share.

\---------------------------------------------

# Upcoming oral Phase 2 VK2735 data

The oral form of VK2735 is currently at the end of its phase 2. As mentioned previously, my models predict that data could be available before September and possibly as soon as the last week of July. 

I just want to say that the share price surged to around $80/share in premarket after their Phase 1 oral data were released, back in November 2024.

The data should, according to my prediction models, be best-in-class, along with a very clean safety profile (similar to Phase 1). There is also a distinct possibility that the data will be blockbuster data. This DD is long enough as it is, so I won't we talking about WL%, but if you are interested, I massively recommend watching the interviews of Andy Hsieh from William Blair Capital and to read his research, this man knows what he is talking about.

\---------------------------------------------

# Finances and Risks

Now, I know a lot of you will say ''but, but, but, it's a biotech, it's going bankrupt!''. Well, no, VKTX has no debt and has $852 million cash-on-hand as of Q1 2025. This is a cash position that is large enough to fund both forms of VK2735 until approval, according to management. This means that the enterprise value of VKTX is 2.6B, which is... MASSIVELY undervalued to say the least.

Analysts seem to agree that VKTX is undervalued because the mean price target is $90 (which is almost a 200% upside), and the only few (2) neutral price targets came from analysts who didn't understand fully VK2735 and didn't want to make any predictions. 

Institutional ownership is also unusually high for a biotech stock, sitting at 70%+.

Risks involved are mainly a failure of VK2735; failure to get FDA approval and financing risks if VKTX goes the GIA path without a partner, the company would have to dilute to get more cash, or get loans.

\---------------------------------------------

# What about the science? Is VK2735 actually good?

Now, why would VK2735 matter if tirzepatide currently leads the market? Based on available data, VK2735 shows comparable or superior efficacy to tirzepatide. Also, VK2735 shows better tolerability and dropout rates, most notably in oral form.

Obviously, data is data and is subject to change until it's approved. But as of right now, VK2735 is shaping up to be the most advanced and best-tolerated oral GLP-1/GIP dual agonist in development (and that's without even talking about subcutaneous VK2735).

\---------------------------------------------

# How can they possibly manufacture anything? VKTX is tiny!!!!!

I know some bears will say ''but, but, but, how can VKTX compete, they have 36 employees, they can't possibly manufacture anything competitive!''. Fear not, they recently signed a manufacturing agreement with CordenPharma for free! Yes, you read this right. VKTX will make $150M in prepayments which will be fully credited against future orders. Massive capacity too: 1B oral tablets/year; 100M/year auto-injectors and 100M/year vial/syringes. Which could be translated to around $40B of revenue per year for VKTX. Yes, you read that right.

\---------------------------------------------

# Is a buyout possible?

The CEO of VKTX has said the company is open to partnerships/buyouts, but so far, nothing leaked. It's possible (and even very likely) that buyout discussions are happening right now, behind the scenes. So what do we know so far?

* Pfizer scrapped its own oral GLP (danuglipron) back in April because of safety issues.
* Pfizer is now without a real weight loss pipeline and Pfizer's CEO said that they wanted to go ''all-in'' in the obesity sector. HOW CAN YOU BE ALL-IN IF YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A PIPELINE would be an interesting question to ask Bourla I think.
* Pfizer's CEO recently said that they had discussions with potential companies but that they had ''crazy demands''. He was definitely, without a doubt, referring to VKTX, who is the only company in this sector that has the leverage to give crazy demands.
* There was a rumor back in February which mentioned that Pfizer was in talks with VKTX, but it was not confirmed.

Pfizer is the most likely to partner with VKTX or buy them out directly. It could be before the end of the year.

\---------------------------------------------

# Why is it so cheap?

You may now be tempted to ask, ''but, but, but, why are you saying that the base case is a PT of $180/share if the stock is -25% YTD and -48% over 1 year?''.

How many times have you read a DD here where someone is posting about a stock that is +200% YTD and you guys are saying well, why didn't you tell us earlier? **THIS IS** the ''earlier''. The stock is kept down both because of the macroenvironment (look at the performance of XBI) and because firms are shorting heavily, for no reason, VKTX. The short ratio is indeed almost 30%, which is crazy. But it's normal for biotech, and it's one of the reasons why you often see crazy moves in biotech stocks. I am not saying it will happen here, but it is definitely a possibility.

\---------------------------------------------

# Final Thoughts

This is the most asymmetric risk/reward biotech play I have ever seen, especially at current share prices. Giant potential upside and limited downside due to cash and varied pipeline.

Is it risk-free? No, welcome to biotech. But this isn't some sketchy 40M market cap company that tries to sell snake oil.

Position : 500 shares. The gray block on the top is hiding a micro-cap stock that can't be discussed on WSB.

Please do not hesistate to give your thoughts or prayers.

  
TLDR: VKTX trading at low share prices because of the macroenvironment. Oral P2 VK2735 data is coming soon. VKTX may go higher. Long term, VKTX may compete with LLY and capture 10-25+% of the TAM which is expected to be 150B by 2032. The TAM was 16B in 2024. = VKTX will go a lot higher.",1752705098.0

While you regards are circle jerking over NVIDIA's $4T market cap, Jensen is furiously dumping shares to add to his personal jacket collection. Meanwhile, Intel is playing the long game.

NVIDIA's GPU dominance is built on training hype and datacenter porn, but they're about to get steamrolled by the most predictable trend in computing history: eventually, everything runs on a fucking potato.

Here's what's really happening, GPUs weren't designed for AI, AI was designed around GPUs. We're literally running neural networks on graphics cards because that's what was available, not because it's optimal. Now that specialized training and inference hardware is coming, this whole house of cards falls apart.

Not every company is training GPT-5. Only for the top players does this even make sense. The real money isn't in the repurposed graphics cards powering today's model training. It's in the purpose-built, boring-ass processors that'll run AI inference on every toaster, doorbell, and sex toy in existence. And Intel is positioning to own that world.

# Dismantling NVIDIA's hype

Let me break this down for you mouth-breathers. Most of you have no idea what CUDA actually is or why it doesn't matter. The funny thing is neither do the companies or their developers building these AI models using it.

I'm a Platform Engineer. Which means I'm the poor bastard who has to productionize and scale the garbage that AI teams try to ship. Let me tell you, most AI ""engineers"" code like toddlers with crayons. It's embarrassing.

Picture this, you've got these script kiddies sitting in their Herman Miller chairs, MacBook Pros gleaming under the open office lighting, staring lovingly at their golden NVIDIA GPUs like they're some sort of religious artifacts. Like you, to these ape-like engineers, CUDA is simply magic. A godlike ethereal force aligning all the fairy dust just right in their $40,000 golden shrine to Jensen.

But it isn't.

CUDA is just a C++ extension with some runtime libraries. That's it. The ""moat"" everyone keeps parroting about doesn't exist because ALL the software frameworks used in the industry support multiple backends. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, they all run on AMD, Intel, custom silicon, whatever. The hardware is completely abstracted away. Most developers never even know what backend they're running on.

These people have zero concept of basic software engineering principles, let alone understanding the backend infrastructure their code runs on. They're statisticians and researchers who learned to use a computer the same way a medieval alchemist learned to use fire.

They believe that if it runs on their MacBook, it's production ready. They write code like they're still submitting homework assignments, except now their homework is burning through millions in compute costs.

# A Fundamental Shift is Coming

At the moment, companies everywhere are conflating training requirements with inference requirements like they're the same thing.

I've seen production deployments at major companies that would make any competent engineer weep. Burning millions per year on H100s because they can't differentiate between development and production requirements. Companies treating every ML workload like they're training GPT-5.

These deployments only exist because companies throw unlimited capex budgets at fundamentally misunderstood architectures just to get a ticket on the AI hype train. But it's not sustainable.

Training requires massive parallel compute for backpropagation. Fine, NVIDIA won that round with their Ferrari hardware. But the market is shifting from training to inference, and inference has completely different optimization requirements.

Inference is single forward passes that need to be cheap, consistent, and efficient, not just fast. A Llama model classifying support tickets doesn't need a $25,000 H100. It needs cost-effective compute that can handle steady loads without breaking the bank. These workloads are perfectly suited for whoever can deliver the best price to performance story. Literally anyone else but NVIDIA.

You can only burn through VC money and corporate budgets for so long before someone starts asking uncomfortable questions. The corporate bean counters are getting nosy about what these ""AI initiatives"" are actually producing for their massive compute spend. When finance realizes they're paying Ferrari prices for Honda Civic workloads, the free money party ends fast. And where does it go? To Intel, AMD, and every custom silicon vendor with a better price-to-performance story.

Remember DeepSeek? When they claimed comparable performance using 2,048 H800s versus competitors' 10,000+ H100s, NVIDIA lost $589 billion in market value in one day. That wasn't market overreaction. That was the market briefly glimpsing reality about AI efficiency.

If that's the market reaction to a boost in training efficiency, imagine what happens when the inference efficiency story becomes undeniable.

Specialized inference chips are already showing 5-20x performance improvements over general-purpose GPUs. When companies realize they can run their workloads on cheaper, more efficient hardware, the migration will be swift and brutal for NVIDIA's margins.

Intel's Gaudi 3 baseboards are delivering 2.9x better price performance to NVIDIA's H100 baseboards.

Meanwhile, Intel trades like a dying company when they're positioned to capture the massive inference market that everyone's ignoring. The technical setup screams bottom, the valuation is absurd, and the fundamental shift is accelerating.

# The Trade:

Positions:

INTC 2600 shares, selling covered calls every other week, selling puts with available cash as collateral.

The way I see it, you're getting paid to wait on a potential 2-3x if the turnaround works. And if it doesn't, you're buying below tangible book value while NVIDIA holders watch their gains evaporate.

INB4 ""why aren't you buying puts on NVIDIA?"":

Listen, that stock has more momentum than a freight train on cocaine. Maybe it keeps ripping to $300 while I'm crying into my positions. But physics applies to stonks too, and what goes parabolic eventually comes back to earth.

I'd rather bet on the inevitable winner of the post-hype reality than try to time the peak of an irrational bubble.
