1kbnosv,Everything about META's earnings tonight,45,34,"Meta is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ±10%, but honestly it's kinda a toss up. Looking back, they went up 5.1% after last earnings. But down 4.9% the one prior. Both moves, less than it's average move. Knowing that Meta *tends* to make a big jump *usually* I wanted to draft up a little discussion post to get the ball rolling. See where we stand.

https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx

As we know, this earnings comes a week after Google's earnings (I did a post on GOOG as well) where the company was able to beat expecations on both the top and bottom lines on the strength of its ad sales. During that company's investor call, Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler said it was too early to comment on the potential economic impact on the current quarter, but did mention that the Trump administration's changes to de minimis exemptions will cause ""a slight headwind to [Google's] ads business in 2025."" 

For the quarter, today Meta is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $5.25 on revenue of $41.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $4.71 on revenue of $36.4 billion in Q1 2024. [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/qkgqCBJ.png)

Advertising revenue is expected to top out at $40.5 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs segment is set to report an operating loss of $4.5 billion and revenue of $496 million.

While Meta has repeatedly beaten Wall Street expectations in the past few quarters, analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company is also planning on spending up to $65bn on AI infrastructure by the end of 2025. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters.

“Meta’s enormous investment in AI infrastructure will continue to weigh heavily on investors when the company reports quarterly earnings on April 30, 2025,” said analyst Debra Aho Williamson, (founder and chief analyst of [Sonata Insights](https://www.sonatainsights.com/)). “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama.”

Debra here isn't the only person with something to say. I've been reading a lot of articles on the stock and read what analysts have been saying. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in an investor note: “We attribute weakness to [Meta’s] greater exposure to advertising (no cloud business for [Meta]) and China-based advertisers (>10% exposure for [Meta]) who have reportedly pulled back on ad spend.” In his own note, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post said he expects to see a modest beat on Q1 revenue but believes the company will offer a more conservative guide for the second quarter.

In the weeks leading up to today's earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But a WSJ report exposed[ the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-sex-a25311bf), were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. I personally don't think this is really a big deal that will affect the stock. But Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, also [admit](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android) that many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot.

Keep in mind, this earning report comes as the company is battling the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-faces-off-with-ftc-as-meta-antitrust-trial-resumes-213352819.html) in court over claims the social media company holds an illegal monopoly over the “personal social networking.” It's kinda fucked, the FTC is looking to force Meta to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp. The commission claims Meta originally purchased the apps as part of a ""buy-or-bury"" campaign to fight off potential competitors. Zuckerburg [did try](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382) to settle with the FTC for $450 million. The commission, however, asked for $30 billion. Zuckerberg eventually raised his offer to $1 billion, but the FTC would only go as low as [$18 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-price-mark-zuckerberg-wasnt-willing-to-pay-to-halt-metas-antitrust-trial-153134257.html)

“Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally being debated in court, the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP, Research Director [Mike Proulx](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/Mike%20Proulx/BIO16024). He mentions that Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. He also noted that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing ""leaky bucket for Meta.""

Zuckerberg has met with Trump several times over recent months as he seeks to develop a closer relationship with the president. For instance, the CEO attended Trump's inauguration in January, and Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. Also in January, Meta had reached a [$25 million settlement with Trump related](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c) to the company’s decision to ban him from its platforms in 2020.

From what I've read, the news is quite bearish. But given the bump up GOOG took with it's advertising revenue, I think all the tech companies this earning season will ultimately do well. That being said, I'm leaning towards calls. A call spread to avoid high IV crush. Thoughts?",1746037736.0

1kbit90,TSLA keeps trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF,148,82,"Since TSLA's disastrous earnings last week, a lot of people have asked how the stock manages to be up in spite of it all. And *part* of the reason is probably that Musk managed to get away with promising to cut his involvement with DOGE back to 1-2 days per week and have this reported as ""Musk stepping back from DOGE"", as if the effects of taking a chainsaw to your own brand were linear with number of hours per week spent doing it.

But I think a lot of the reason TSLA managed to have a run of good trading days in spite of terrible earnings is that on those days, the S&P 500 was up, and TSLA seems to spend a lot of time trading like a leveraged S&P 500 ETF.

I had a vague, intuitive sense of this, but I wanted to put some numbers on it. There've been 68 trading day's since Trump's inauguration (not counting the currently ongoing trading day). On 26 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down. On 22 of those days, TSLA and the S&P 500 were both up. And there were 14 days where the S&P 500 was up while TSLA was down, but only 6 days where TSLA was up while the S&P 500 was down.

So the first thing to notice here is there's a bit of an asymmetry—on days when the S&P 500 was up, TSLA was up a little more than 60% of the time, whereas on days when the S&P 500 was down, TSLA was down more than 80% of the time.

The other thing is the magnitude of the swings. On days both TSLA and the S&P 500 were up, TSLA was up more in all but two cases. But on days when TSLA and the S&P 500 were both down, TSLA was down more in *every single case.* A linear regression of TSLA's price movements and the S&P 500's gives you a slope of about 2.14, meaning that on average (and I must emphasize this is an average), if the S&P moves by 1%, TSLA can be expected to move by more than 2%.

What's going on here? Well, first of all, TSLA should have very little ability to push around the S&P 500 by itself. It may be a ""megacap"" fund, but its weight in the S&P 500 is less than 2%, and even AAPL is less than 7%. On the other hand, S&P 500 index funds probably push around TSLA a lot—inflows and outflows into index funds, whether traditional mutual funds or ETFs, result in buying and selling of the components, affecting their price. That's how index funds are *supposed* to work.

The real question is why the changes are consistently amplified. Part of the story is probably that TSLA has a high P/E ratio, and companies with high P/E ratios are just in general more sensitive to market trends (something you can see if you compare the implied volatility on growth ETFs to the implied volatility on value ETFs). I do wonder if there's an additional factor, that TSLA has been in the news a lot, contributing to its volatility, which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because volatility attracts gamblers and because quants build the observed volatility into their models.

An important upshot of this: even though I am not kidding when I say I [expect SPY to go to 420](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ji8bie/spy_to_420/), I've never bought SPY puts, because I expect that *real* pain from the China tariffs hits in a few weeks, TSLA will crash even harder than the broad market. There are probably other stocks you could make this play with, though I don't have a specific one I really like. (Notably, I recently opened a short position on PLTR, then thought better of it and closed the position at a small loss after deciding their bull case was significantly less implausible than TSLA's.)

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. TSLA is a high-beta stock. I've known about CAPM for years but always hear about it in the context of people wanting *low*\-beta investments, which is probably why I blanked on applying it to TSLA.

1kbhjfa,Treasury yields rising is a terrible sign and not similar to Covid recovery,659,175,"GDP/stocks down while yields go up is not the same as when it happens from Covid recovery. It’s much worse.

Keep seeing the sentiment that yields up and stock market down is just a recent trend and doesn’t mean anything negative. 

That is not the case here.  If the sentiment was overwhelmingly positive that the economy was going to suddenly do a lot better after a downturn then perhaps yield would go up. During recovery from COVID, there was stimulus and optimism  of economy recovering. During the offset of COVID itself yields went down and stocks up because there was still trust in the US dollar and that allowed further tools for economic recovery. 


There is NO positive reason yields would be going up right now. These are caused by geopolitical tensions. Countries are and we have reports of this dumping us bonds. There is also less trust in the us bond. Also fear of debt problems. While covid was recovering this was still optimistic as economy was going towards steady recovery.  Stagflation from tariffs is not a meme and something economists kept warning about. If government can’t have the flexibility to cut inflation they can’t use deficit to stimulate the economy.

This is a dangerous sign. I’d be cautious to alarmed right now 



Edit: Obviously don't use this to influence any stock market decisions. This moreso a warning sign in regards to what may end up happening if there isn't a quick reverse. These warning signs would have the heavier impact not be felt until further down the line and hard to know how much damage/permanent damage until 2nd quarter. ",1746022363.0

1kb4qy9,$META Earnings already priced in — be careful on Calls,65,43,"I’ve noticed that when people expect something to happen in the market, they often price in the movement before it happens. It’s harder to make money off of that initial move, but it’s easier to gamble on them being wrong…or less right. 

Especially around earnings time, as we all saw with TSLA, everyone knew their earning would be shit. So the stock moved like shit. Then the earnings were horrendous. And we pumped??? I’m well aware that TSLA is a meme stock and makes 0 sense, but I also believe that there is a lesson in that movement. 

I think there is a possibility of the flip side for META. Everyone thinks they’re going to have good earnings. The forecasts are high and the stock is up (with the rest of the market) in the last few days. 

Furthermore, in the past 10 *straight* quarters META has outperformed earnings estimates. Yet, they do not rise on earnings every time. Additionally, the news of AI advances and AD revenue has already been priced in, in my opinion, so I am doubting that this will affect META movement post earnings.

So, if everyone is *right* and META outperforms? I think we have an after hours pump followed by a market open selloff, from the pump, back to a modest gain. 

If META underperforms? Blood. Many are  expecting META to meet or beat expectations, as it’s done for the past 10 quarters. 

If META meets forecasts? I think there’s a decent chance we see red movement due to a pre-pricing of good earnings. 

To back up this silly little thesis I have a table of META’s earnings reports along side the stock’s movement the week before, movements in after-hours, the following day, and week. 

First thing you’ll notice in this chart is that last quarter the data shows me to be wrong. To my knowledge the news of new ad strategies and AI advancements dropped then which contributed to the gain. The quarter before that however, the data shows me being correct. I also think that the high volatility of this market could heavily contribute to a drop on positive earnings. Look at $SNAP. 

Last thing I’ll add is earnings are always extremely unpredictable like everyone knows. I’m a regard who is trying to recognize a pattern where there may not be one, but god damn it I’ll lose money trying to find one! 

TL;DR 
I believe the market already priced in a positive earnings for META. Looking at past data, it’s possible that even if META exceeds estimates, the stock will drop. And if earnings meet or are below expectations META should be strongly red. I’m not buying calls and would recommend being cautious. Puts could be the move but everything is a lotto around earnings.

3. Targeting 3.5× to 7× returns over the decade (so around £175K–£350K by 2035).

4. Once the LISA matures, I’ll use it to buy a property in cash — specifically a student house in a high-yield UK city (like Nottingham, Manchester, or Bradford).

5. I’ll live in it for ~6 months (to meet LISA rules), then move out and rent it full-time to students.

6. Targeting rental yields of 10–12%, so I can recoup my initial £40K in three years, and then let rental income snowball. I’m currently doing so well on my portfolio too due MSTR increase!

Why MSTR + SMH?
1. MSTR is my Bitcoin leverage play. If BTC does 5–10× this decade, MSTR could go parabolic.

2. SMH gives me exposure to the semiconductor/AI boom — secular growth, real earnings, global tailwinds.

3. Both are high beta, high conviction long-term plays for me.

Not Interested In:
1. Mortgages (as I’m Muslim)
2. Rent-a-room schemes
3. Selling the property — this is for long-term cash flow (or maybe I could to retrieve back house purchase price)

Curious to Hear:
1. Anyone else planning to exit into hard assets like real estate?
2. Thoughts on the MSTR + SMH pairing for this kind of 10-year strategy?
3. Any red flags I might be missing?

I thought it was a good long term play then but didn't buy.

Bought some with leverage at $2.4 and made something on the way, curious what you think about the weird recent action and the earnings call next week. 

Here's what I know so far in a tldr version.   
Might do a fully fledged DD if you regards don't hate too much on the stock because it's borderline meme. 



# Key Challenges

* Mohawk Valley fab at only 20% utilization
* Heavy capex + deep cash burn
* Pending $750M CHIPS Act funding
* 20% workforce reduction amid cost-cutting
* Poor investor sentiment + institutional exits

I get that some of it might make sense given they want to build capacity for the future market of EVs rather than the present. Nevertheless, they burn a lot of cash. Although, there are quite a few catalysts for the short to mid term.

# Catalysts

* **May 2025 Earnings**: Critical turning point for guidance/fab update
* **New CEO Bounce**: Feurle’s credibility may reset the narrative
* **CHIPS Act Award**: Would ease balance sheet pressure
* **Rate Cuts**: Growth names like WOLF benefit most
* **EV Momentum**: 125 EV models using WOLF SiC tech
* **Bonus**: >[40% float shorted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-most-shorted-u-s-stock-is-this-indebted-chip-supplier-b60bc024) = maybe we see some volatile upside?



**Upside Scenario**

**Conditions**: ✔️ Fab ramps above 30% ✔️ CHIPS funding confirmed ✔️ New CEO delivers clarity and vision ✔️ Macro supports capital flows back into growth

  
**Downside Scenario:**  ✔️ Good ol' loss porn  

  
I know it's beaten down as hell, but would it go bust? I doubt it.   
I don't like the previous management, nor their financials, but I'm bullish on the new CEO.  
He's an industry veteran and actually was leading [a proposed acquisition](https://www.wolfspeed.com/company/news-events/news/cree-announces-termination-of-wolfspeed-and-infineon-sale-transaction/) of Wolfspeed by Infineon in 2017, which was shut down from the US gov because the tech is too sensitive. This tells me the guy knows the company for a long time and probably has some strong opinions.

   
Tempted to go Yolo if it drops further.

**Current Price:** $72 

**Price target:** $45 ---> implied return of **37%**

**Next Catalyst is Q1 earnings date:** May 1, 2025 

**Positions:** A combination of short and long dated puts - will keep rolling them over no matter how long it takes.

 *Floor & Decor looks like a retail score,* 

*But it’s Blockbuster in disguise — just with more tile on the floor.* 

*The CFO was back, running the same old game,* 

*Where the earnings look shiny, but the numbers are lame.* 

*They lease every store like commitment’s a sin,* 

*With off-book liabilities stacked to the brim.* 

*Over 80% of revenue’s tied to rent they don’t own —* 

*It’s basically WeWork with a better backsplash tone.* 

*They open new stores they don’t even own,* 

*In towns where folks can’t get a loan.* 

*They’re swiping the card on growth they can’t fund,* 

*Praying the foot traffic isn’t a ghost town run.*

**Executive Summary** 

At $73 a share, Floor & Decor (FND) is basically a bad Airbnb investment — mostly leases, no ownership, and the photos look way better than reality. With a realistic price target of $45 (implied return of 38%), this stock is more “demo day” than “renovation boom.” 

The company’s genius growth strategy? Open a bunch of stores they don’t own, in locations people can’t afford to shop, using money they don’t really have, by committing to 10-20 year leases. Same-store sales are down 2 years in a row, margins down, and lease debt is stacked higher than their laminate displays. 

Their CFO (now president) used to work at Blockbuster and Carter's — so if you’re wondering whether they know how to ride a dying business into the ground, the answer is: absolutely. 

This isn’t a business — it’s a liquidation sale waiting for a date. 

**Analysts are underestimating the true leverage on their balance sheet**

FND's debt should include all contractual obligations. The company's FV of lease liabilities represent over 50% of their annual sales, creating an enormous, fixed cost burden that remains largely underestimated from traditional financial analysis. This off-balance sheet financing strategy in my opinion, is far more aggressive than industry peers Home Depot and Lowe's, who own a higher percentage of their locations. 

Adding insult to injury, the company employs $167M in reverse factoring within trade payables, which carries the risk of cash conversion issues.

They also have around $450M of lease contracts signed but not started that is off balance sheet, and as such, should be added to debt to get a more representative leverage of the company.

***Other notable areas of potential risk:*** 

* **Spartan acquisition** (commercial segment) does not include a detailed reporting and is a “non-reporting segment” despite contributing 200M+ in revenues. Significant assumptions are used for assessing its fair value, which means that if this subsidiary underperforms, we cannot rule out a big write off in future years. Management provides no detailed breakdown of sales, expenses, KPIs to track this new investment, ROIC, or any other metric than can be meaningfully used to track its performance.
* **Other liabilities** seems to be a black box, even though it is not a small amount.
* **Supply Chain Finance (SCF)** grew 47% year-over-year, representing a financial liability classified as accounts payable that artificially improves cash flow from operations and days payable outstanding while understating leverage, with $54M of the $514M in SCF invoices remaining unpaid at year-end, potentially creating risk if suppliers cut contracts or banks reduce financing due to tariffs or rising interest rates. 
* **Stock-based compensation** has **doubled** in just two years, outpacing both revenue and net income growth, creating pressure on margins while being excluded from EBITDA calculations, revealing a concerning disconnect between pay and performance as TSR awards and RSUs continue to vest despite consecutive annual declines in Revenues, EBIT and net income from $298M in FY22 to $206M in FY24. Ask yourself, why is management’s pay significantly higher than its peers HD and Lowes, while they have underperformed in the past 2 years?
   * Even more importantly, management's performance metrics are predominantly based on operating margins rather than revenues (unlike Home Depot and Lowe's, where management performance is 45% based on revenues and 45% on margins). This creates a misaligned incentive structure where executives are rewarded for minimizing operating expenses rather than growing the top line, potentially encouraging earnings manipulation rather than sustainable business expansion. 
   * Insider initiated a new pre-scheduled trading plan (third in a row!) enabling sales of up to 100,000 shares over 180 days (Feb-Aug 2025) - notably not a simple rollover but a fresh plan established right before year-end when EPS hit a 3-year low, and SBC and leasing costs peaked. This potentially opportunistic timing represents a bearish signal, as the substantial share volume (worth several million dollars) isn't offset by insider buying, and any actual selling in Q1 amid 2025's market drawdown would further suggest management lacks confidence in near-term recovery prospects. Insiders have been steadily selling their shares. *refer to Appendix.* 
* For a company that has possibility to have many segments (whether by end user, Pros vs DIY) or by Retail vs commercial segment, or online vs stores, it is quite odd for them to not report financials by any segment. Practically unheard of in the retail industry.
* If you look at the change in accounting disclosures and policies around key areas such as leases, assets, gift cards, SCF, and segment reporting over the years since 2019, you will be surprised to see them conveniently changing these disclosures and methods constantly. While “allowed” by accounting standards, it is far from being considered good practice. 

**Rapidly Deteriorating Operations** 

Same-store sales have turned negative and show no signs of recovery. Management's guidance for improvement in H2 2025 strains credibility given rising mortgage rates, weak consumer spending, and housing affordability challenges. The company's pivot toward lower-margin product categories (tools and installation materials now 21% vs. 17% previously) signals eroding pricing power in core offerings. 

Despite two years of declining same store sales, capex and opex has been growing and staying at the same levels of revenue continuously!

Despite these warning signs, FND continues an aggressive and reckless store expansion program *(20-30 new stores annually, expected to open another 25 in FY2025)* that has consumed over $1B in capital over just two years. This expansion strategy appears designed to mask underlying weakness, creating a dangerous spiral of increasing fixed costs against deteriorating sales performance. *The company has started reducing the number of stores they had initially planned to open, though they keep opening them. Why? Cause t*hat has historically been their only growth strategy.

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities & Tariff Exposure** 

With nearly all products imported and a staggering 11% of revenue dependent on a single Chinese supplier, FND faces catastrophic margin risk from rising tariffs. They import most of their products (18% from China)

Unlike competitors with more diversified supply chains, even modest tariff increases could completely eliminate FND's already-shrinking profit margins. Furthermore, since FND removed the middle man when sourcing their supply, they don't have the same flexibility and speed to re-arrange their sourcing as they would need to personally go and find new suppliers.

*Please note, that though tariffs persisting could significantly speed up the short thesis, my thesis is despite tariff uncertainty.*

**Questionable Leadership & Reporting Practices** (Serious)

The recently retired CFO's background (Taylor Lang, now president) at two previous companies that struggled financially and that restated its financials after Lang left, for the years Lang was at the company - raises serious red flags about financial stewardship. The widening gap between GAAP and adjusted metrics (GAAP EPS declined 31% YoY in 2024) strongly suggests manipulation to present a more favorable narrative than operational reality supports. Meanwhile, insiders continue aggressive selling with negligible open-market purchases. 

**During his tenure at Blockbuster (1999-2003)** – After he left, in 2006, the audit committee restated its 2003 financials. In 2003, actual cash flows were lower by almost 60% than that reported! The company’s BOD recommended against relying on those years’ financials as a result. 

**During his time at Carter’s (2003-2007) -** After he left, in 2009, the company announced that the financial statements from 2004 to 2008 should no longer be relied upon! I know, I know, insane right?

**Off-Balance Sheet Leverage: The Hidden Debt Bomb** 

Floor & Decor's true financial risk is dramatically understated due to its massive off-balance sheet obligations, with lease liabilities comprising more than 80% of their annual revenues, and additional long term lease liabilities that are signed but not started yet of $450M. This proportion dwarfs industry norms and creates an enormous fixed cost burden that functions effectively as debt without appearing in traditional leverage metrics. Unlike competitors Home Depot and Lowe's who wisely own a much higher percentage of their locations (80% owned vs leased), FND has constructed a precarious financial structure where even modest sales declines could trigger a rapid spiral toward default. (almost mostly leased) Combined with $167M in reverse factoring hidden within trade payables, the company has engineered a misleading picture of its true leverage position—creating a ticking time bomb that will likely detonate as same-store sales continue deteriorating and leases become increasingly unsustainable.

**The Lumber Liquidators Parallel** 

The similarities to Lumber Liquidators' collapse are striking and impossible to ignore. Both companies pursued aggressive expansion through leased locations, relied heavily on imports, faced product quality litigation, and employed questionable financial reporting practices. When Lumber Liquidators' same-store sales deteriorated, the company rapidly spiraled toward lease defaults and eventual bankruptcy. In 2015, a ""60 Minutes"" report revealed that Lumber Liquidators' laminate flooring imported from China contained hazardous levels of formaldehyde. The formaldehyde controversy and subsequent investigations caused Lumber Liquidators' stock price to plummet, impacting its financial stability.  As you saw above, FND has also been subject to the same litigations for years.

|**Category**|**Lumber Liquidators**|**Floor & Decor (FND)**|**Takeaway / Risk**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Supply Chain**|Heavy China import dependency|11% of revenue from a single Chinese supplier|Tariff/geopolitical risk is dangerously concentrated|
|**Product Mix**|Mostly wood/laminate|More diversified: tile, vinyl, laminate|Broader mix, but still tied to cyclical housing trends|
|**Leadership**|Frequent C-suite turnover|CFO tied to two bankruptcies (Blockbuster, Carter’s)|Governance red flags and questionable financial oversight|
|**Market Focus**|Failed pivot to Pro customers|Targeting Pro segment w/ digital support|Slightly better execution, but still at risk in a housing slowdown|
|**Store Expansion**|Rapid growth without scale|Still adding 20–30 stores annually|Overbuilding risk as demand wanes|
|**Inventory**|Overstocking|$1.2B in inventory (high WC usage)|Capital tied up — may need markdowns if traffic softens|
|**Fixed Costs**|Lease-heavy, struggled in downturns|Similar lease structure as LL|Margin compression risk during traffic declines|
|**Litigation**|Formaldehyde scandal, $36M fine|Prior injury litigation + $14M formaldehyde settlement|Insurance may cover cost, but brand damage persists|
|**Financials**|Comps turned negative, margins eroded|Negative comps, rising lease burden|Both show signs of structural deterioration|

FND is showing alarming parallels to Lumber Liquidators’ path to bankruptcy. With 11% of sales tied to a single Chinese supplier, it’s highly exposed to tariffs and supply chain shocks. Their litigations and the stark similarity and gravity to the litigations, while insured for now, shows they are on the verge of a significant decline if another litigation further puts their reputation at risk. More critically, lease liabilities exceed 80% of sales—an off-balance sheet burden that becomes deadly as comps decline. Like LL, FND is trapped in a dangerous loop: opening more stores to mask weakening fundamentals. Despite better branding and a more diverse mix, the structural risks—over-expansion, margin erosion, and fixed-cost pressure—suggest a looming unraveling.

**Investment Conclusion** 

Shorting Floor & Decor is like shorting a piñata at a kid’s party — you know it’s stuffed with surprises, and none of them are good. This is **not** a misunderstood growth story. It’s a **fragile, lease-fueled treadmill** with deteriorating comps, manipulated margins, and not enough fixed assets. Unless there’s a complete replacement of management and strategy, or unless there is an immediate macro miracle — housing boom, lower rates, rising consumer confidence — **I am highly convicted that their stock is highly overvalued.**

1ka1tlu,NNE is overvalued compared to OKLO,28,10,"NNE is an early-stage nuclear company founded in 2022, that wants to build the world’s first portable nuclear reactor. They also want to be a vertically integrated company that handles reactor design, nuclear fuel enrichment, transport, and consulting. Their market cap is currently around $1.1 billion, with an unknown number of employees (pretty sure it’s not 5 as reported by Robinhood).

The stock is currently up 500% since its May 2024 IPO around $4 (ATH was $48.5 / 1000%). That in itself isn’t unheard of for companies today (especially the 2021 IPOs/SPACs that got wrecked in 2022 to recover sharply in 2024). But what makes NNE stand out is how little they had in place at IPO: no patents, no prototypes, no regulatory progress, and no strong internal technical team. The founder has no nuclear experience and has been involved in some small companies in the mining sector that have gone nowhere. The CEO does have legitimate nuclear experience (UK DoD, Rolls-Royce), so that’s a positive.

Normally, companies need to put together an actual team and some IP before trying to raise big money. NNE did not seem to have any of these. A short-seller (Hunterbrook media) highlighted these deficiencies last year. The stock dropped for a bit, but then bounced back after NNE lawyered up with a big-name attorney and threatened to sue.

Since then, they’ve been trying to fix the optics by buying patents from other third-parties, hiring more PhDs and advisors, signing some agreements with other companies for far-dated future work, and applying for research grants with universities. But it still feels like they IPO’d first and are only now building the actual company.

For perspective, OKLO has been at this for over a decade and is only worth about 3.5x NNE’s market cap. Posts about NNE on r/nuclear have been pretty critical. Also, their timelines for getting a reactor built and approved are very unrealistic. Institutional holdings are about 30% (per Yahoo finance) as it meets the criteria for clean energy investment focused ETFs. Retail ownership is probably around 50%. I suspect that many OKLO and SMR retail investors have also invested in NNE without realizing it is a much more immature company in comparison to its market cap.

TL;DR – NNE might eventually build something good, but right now it looks way overpriced for where they actually are tech-wise. There is no reason for the stock to fall immediately besides macroeconomic factors that are less likely to reward risky ventures. This is why I am going with slightly longer-dated put options. The premiums are indeed expensive, but the longer dates provide some protection in case the stock decides to rally for a short while with a macro-economic improvement.

EPS for 2024 was around 211 but estimates for 2025 is around 260, hence the reason for current SPX price.

Looking at how the market recovered last week, seems like they are still expecting earning growth to persist this year and next year too. They think this tariff drama will be wrapped up very soon or it will not have much effect on earnings (assuming valuation matters).

IIRC, if earnings decline, things can get very ugly as it occured in 2022-2023 (see below EPS chart for some context).

Only caveat is, if we get into mild recession and rates are cut to zero that may provide some support to stocks.

Another thing: I feel like stocks these days are under pricing risk premium, it's almost like a speculation where everyone thinks price will mostly go up so there is no risk in buying stocks.

1k9smxj,$HWKN DD – Big winner from tariff induced supply shortages,19,11,"**Description:**

Hawkins, Inc. (“HWKN”) is a regional distributor of bulk commodity chemicals and value-added derivatives of industrial and water treatment chemicals. With the recent rollout of Trump’s tariffs, I believe HWKN serves to benefit from elevated earnings due to ongoing, favorable supply issues that will allow the company to raise prices above raw material costs that will result in record profit spreads per unit sold. 

**Summary of business:** 

HWKN has three operating segments: industrial, water treatment, and health & nutrition. 

**Industrial:** supplies industrial chemicals to a diverse customer base serving multiple industries such as agriculture, chemical processing, electronics, energy, food, pharmaceutical and plating. This group’s principal products are acids, alkalis and food-grade and pharmaceutical salts and ingredients.
* Manufactures derivative commodity chemical products such as bleach (sodium hypochlorite), certain food-grade and pharmaceutical products (including liquid phosphates, lactates and other blended products), and agricultural products
* Receives, stores and distributes various chemicals in bulk quantities, including liquid caustic soda, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, urea, phosphoric acid, aqua ammonia and potassium hydroxide.
* Repackages water treatment chemicals for their Water Treatment Group and bulk industrial chemicals to sell in smaller quantities to customers

The majority of the industrial segment revenues are generated from manufactured, blended, or repackaged chemicals or “specialty products.” While the company uses the “specialty chemicals” terminology for many of its products, they are commodity chemicals and derivatives blended or created from base chemicals that are readily available.

**Water Treatment:** specializes in supplying chemicals, products, equipment, services, and solutions for potable water, municipal and industrial wastewater, industrial process water, non-residential swimming pool water and agricultural water.
* Supplies full line of general water treatment chemicals targeting small rural towns / municipalities and small industrial companies
* Utilizes delivery route sales / service business model on a regional basis supplying lower volume deliveries of water treatment chemicals. 

This segment has grown meaningfully in the last five years from acquisitions and continues to be a key aspect of their growth strategy going forward. Since FY 2021, the company has completed nine acquisitions spending ~$150mm in total. Management has stated they pay, on average, 7-10x EBITDA implying those acquisitions have added ~$15mm to $20mm EBITDA. The company has done a good job of executing the roll-up strategy and from channel checks, they are well regarded in the industry for their service and niche market focus on smaller customers. 

**Health & Nutrition:** specializes in providing ingredient distribution, processing, and formulation solutions to manufacturers of health and wellness products. Types of products include: minerals (e.g. magnesium, manganese, calcium, etc), excipients, natural B vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, etc. 

The core business model for vast majority of HWKN’s business is essentially purchasing commodity chemicals in bulk (such as caustic soda, chlorine, and sulfuric acid) then repackaging or blending to create derivative products that are sold in smaller quantities to end users and earn a $ spread per unit. 

From conversations with competitors and the company, the industry tends to perform best during periods of volatility in commodity prices when distributors enjoy temporary surges in profitability from expansion in spreads. Post-COVID 2020 to 2023 were some of the most profitable years for HWKN and the upcoming years with the supply chain shocks from Trump’s tariffs look to be yet another profitable timeframe for the company.  

**Commodity Price Volatility Creates Temporary Favorable Environment for Distributors**

The primary factor driving the earnings surge at HWKN over the last four years has been the supply disruption and shortages that resulted from COVID-19 and the subsequent curtailment of chlor-alkali production capacity. This led to a historic spike in the cost of chlorine and caustic soda from 2020 through end of 2023. These supply shortages created panic among customers who were concerned about availability of products, allowing distributors like HWKN to charge prices well in excess of cost increases. This drove a surge in margins and profits for distributors despite selling lower volumes. Peers consistently remarked on the record profits achieved, citing a ""once in a lifetime"" environment created by the combination of hyperinflation and product shortages. For example, multiple distributors explained that if they were facing 20-30% raw material price increases, they were able to get at least 50% price increases from their end customers. 

Large chemical distributors, such as Brenntag and Univar, revealed that there has been a change from historical norms in profitability between two distinct chemical product groups: organic solvents (e.g. ethanol, acetone, methanol, etc) and inorganics (caustic soda, chlorine, sulfuric acid, ammonia, etc), which is the only type of chemicals that HWKN works with. For decades, distributors earned higher spreads in organic solvents versus inorganics and viewed the organic solvents business as more attractive. The market changed after the pandemic and inorganics became much more profitable due to the shortages. Larger distributors have since been shifting their mix towards inorganics where they were previously under-indexed. 

HWKN was an outsized beneficiary as its strong regional presence with smaller customers resulted in less competition from larger distributors, who were focused on supplying larger clients in an environment with limited supply. Also, HWKN is almost exclusively exposed to the inorganic chemicals, such as caustic soda and sulfuric acid, that experienced much larger spikes in both demand (used as disinfectant and coagulant) and supply shortages from decline in capacity as well as supply chain disruptions.

Since the beginning of 2024, market conditions had stabilized as supply and availability of raw materials significantly improved and was normalizing to pre-pandemic levels. On top of that, demand had been softening and commodity prices were stabilizing. Recent channel checks suggested that distributors were shifting their strategic priorities towards market share and volume gains, versus pricing and spread expansion. But these stabilization trends have now been once again undone with the implementation of Trump’s tariffs which will lead to supply shortages once again and will once again allow distributors like HWKN to charge prices well in excess of cost increases, significantly increasing revenues and gross margin. 

**TLDR: Tariff induced supply shortages will allow HWKN to make more money**

The average American holds roughly $8000 in credit card debt, this isn't accounting for mortgage debt which is it's own beast entirely (roughly $250000 per homeowner).

The average American pays about $200-300 a week on groceries which isn't great but it's manageable. With the tariff goods rolling in on ships soon (especially those from China), we could see that grocery bill move up double which means that people will have to start paying using more of their credit.

1k9azf5,Is This Market Bounce a Trap? Rising Risks Could Signal More Downside (April 2025),1508,541,"The market bounced last week.
But don’t be fooled — this is classic fakeout territory.
Here’s why:

Historical Patterns After Crashes:
- In 2008, the S&P jumped +19% — then collapsed another -28%.
- In 2000, Nasdaq bounced +40% — only to plummet -70%.
- In 2020, a +10% bounce quickly turned into a -35% crash.
→ Early recoveries are often just a setup for the next drop.

Today’s Risks (April 2025):
- Trump’s tariffs on China and global imports continue to rise, creating massive inflationary pressure.
- This will crush margins and slow growth, while keeping the Fed stuck.
- No rate cuts in sight — just higher taxes and stagflation risks.
- Corporate earnings already under strain. Revisions getting ugly.
- Credit stress is rising. Spreads are widening.
- Retail is still all-in, buying this dip with no clear catalyst for recovery.

Bottom Line:
- History shows that first green candles after selloffs are headfakes.
- The market’s core fundamentals are weakening, not improving.
- This rally is probably just short covering and FOMO — not real recovery.
- Real bottoms happen after fear — not wishful thinking.

TLDR:
This bounce is dangerous. With rising tariffs, inflation, and collapsing earnings, the real risk is much lower, not higher.
Stay cautious — don’t get trapped by the rally.",1745778867.0

But the bigger a stock is, the harder it is for retail traders to move its price. And lot of retail trading takes the form of two actions, ""put money in"" and ""pull money out""—meaning it's one thing for retail traders to affect the overall level of the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, but it's a lot less clear what determines the price of the stocks in those indices relative to *each other*.

I expect someone to chime in with ""market makers"", but a lot of people seem confused about how market makers make money. Market makers live to make money off people who have no idea what they're doing, and live in fear of trading with anyone who has any idea what's going on. The traditional way they react to news is by *trading less*.

Now, the ""react to news by trading less"" thing often isn't symmetrical. If news seems good, neutral at worse, market makers can raise their asks while leaving their bids be (at least until they've gotten a chance to see how everyone reacts). If news seems bad, neutral at best, they can do the opposite. But ultimately, they're just guessing what other people will do—and they don't even care about what other people will do in a year, a month, even a week. At most, they care about what will happen tomorrow, and only if they're providing liquidity for a *really big trade* where their position will take time to unwind. So they might be part of the story, but not as much as people thing.

Another answer is ""big institutional investors"". This was almost certainly the correct answer 35 years ago. Since then, however, two things have happened. The first is the rise of index funds, which now control a *majority* of the assets managed by mutual funds. But on top of that, there's ""closet indexers""—mutual funds that are *technically* actively managed, but whose portfolios look a lot like index funds, because their managers' incentives are mostly on the side of not underperforming their benchmarks too much.

Still, even if only 10% of the money in the stock market is being genuinely actively managed by professional investors, that's still a lot. How much do *they* move the market? I... honestly don't know. There's absolutely no question if somebody drops a market order to buy or sell a million shares of something, that person will wind up trading through the order book and causing a big price swing. But that literally never happens except by accident. It's called ""fat fingering"" for a reason.

If you want to trade a million shares of something *on purpose,* maybe you call around trying to find the best quote, or maybe you trade in a dark pool. Or maybe you have a computer that lets you enter a trade and have the computer do the trade gradually, a little bit at a time, at semi-random interval in semi-random lots with a semi-random mix of market orders and limit orders with semi-random prices, all in service of making your one big trade look like a bunch of little trades in order to trick the market makers who, as noted above, are living in fear of accidentally trading with you. (I have heard such things exist, though I am speculating somewhat on the details.)

How much do genuine, actively managed funds move the price of individual large-cap stocks when they use *those* tactics? Beats me. And that's all I got. What do people think?",1745773291.0

I analyzed how the IG Weekend US Tech 100 moved and whether weekend losses could predict further downside on Monday.

Here’s what I found:
- 68% accuracy: When the index dropped over the weekend, it also fell on Monday in most cases.
- Correlation 0.52: Weekend and Monday moves are moderately positively correlated.

Conclusion: If you're trading short, watching weekend declines can statistically give you an edge for Monday setups – but beware of news-driven reversals.

As per 27 April the Index change is at around -0,3% (-66bips):

1k8fd10,Why there's a good chance Trump kills any deals Bessent brings him,457,147,"When it comes to Trump's tariffs on America's largest trading partners, there was not a lot of good news this week. No one's even pretending to have hope on Canada and Mexico. The EU is signaling they'll be patient, but it's pretty clear by that they mean they're willing to patiently wait for Trump to back down.

And China responded to Trump claiming talks were going well by *denying talks were happening at all*. It's also been reported that China is lifting its own retaliatory tariffs on some semiconductors and some pharmaceuticals, but that seems to be a matter of reducing the pain tariffs cause for China while keeping the pain on the for the US.

When it comes to America's second tier of trading partners—countries like India and Japan—there's more reason for optimism. Talks are at least actually happening. Unfortunately, whether any deals *actually* happen probably depends on how convincingly everyone else involved can lie to Trump and convince him the deals will do what he wants, when clearly no deal will do any such thing.

The problem, here, is that Trump's stated goal is the *total elimination of the US trade deficit.*Not that he regularly uses technical jargon like ""trade deficit"", but he talks constantly how much money we're ""losing"" from trade, and when he gives numbers they generally appear to be based on real statistics about the trade deficit.

For example, when Trump announced new tariffs on almost every country in the world on April 2nd, he claimed they were retaliation for other countries' tariffs, ""including currency manipulation and trade barriers"". But the actual numbers were just our trade deficit with each country in percentile terms. Trump appears to assume any trade deficit is in itself proof of unfair trade practices.

Similarly, he's consistently claimed that under Biden we were ""losing"" $2 billion a day to other countries. Sometimes the number is $3 billion—while taking questions in the Oval Office on Tuesday the number somehow got up to $5 billion—but $2-3 billion is consistent with the actual goods trade deficit for most of the Biden administration, which tended to be somewhere between $60 billion and $90 billion for any given month.

It's not really clear why you'd *want* to eliminate this trade deficit, since it's largely being driven the US being seen as a great place to invest in, creating enormous international demand for US stocks and bonds, including but by no means limited to US Treasuries. But even if you *did* want to eliminate the trade deficit, it's not clear what a series of deals with other countries to eliminate it would even look like.

That means the deals US trade negotiators are currently attempting to hammer out with their foreign counterparts *will not accomplish Trump's stated goals*. That, in turn, means selling those deals to Trump is going to depend on people bullshitting him into thinking the deals do things they will not and cannot do. Will it work? Maybe. I certainly can't blame people for trying.

But I also can't avoid seeing the parallels with what happened with Canada and Mexico in February and March. Trump threatened them with tariffs on February 1st, then announced a 30 day ""pause"" after Trudeau and Sheinbaum offered him a bunch of ""concessions"" that consisted mostly of things they were already doing. For a moment, it looked like catastrophe may have been averted by the power of sheer bullshit. But then, on March 4th, the tariffs went into effect on schedule.

Two days later, I went into my Vanguard account and sold more or less everything, abandoning my longstanding commitment to ""VT and chill"". So far, I don't regret it.

1k8cbl5,Hertz: Here's Why I'm Planning To Get In With OTM Puts,151,86,"# Summary of my Bear Case

* The high short interest led to a spectacular rally following Bill Ackman's fund announcement of a 4.1% stake in the Hertz.
* Bloomberg just announced (April 25) that the company is looking to raise $500 million through debt or (and this is key) **equity**.
* I believe the company will dilute investors at the start of next week. That will probably lead to a selloff (like it is usually the case, after an equity offering).
* I'm planning to buy OTM puts, with a price target of $5 over the next 2-3 months. I am not a degen (despite my profile name), so I need theta to be on my side, baby!
* I believe Hertz could be cooked. Revenue is down, despite decent utilization rates. That means the company is renting cars at lower prices to keep demand.
* Tariffs will most likely not improve its vehicle's residual values, as Trump may pause sectoral tariffs on autos.
* Airlines have recently reported a decline in air travel. Considering that 65% of the company's revenue comes from airport locations, that is another headwind to consider.
* Overall, I believe the AI / robotaxi infrastructure nonsense is not alligned with the company's simplification strategy. I have big doubts Bill Ackman will be able to pursue management into this business venture.

# Fundamentals

Both Americas and International revenues are down, yoy.

https://preview.redd.it/etiyipbsy5xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=858fb1e84fd69f7a1ac5106d8a8e50dec9f91fbf

Here is the yoy variation:

Americas:

* Q4 2024: -7.5%
* Q3 2024: -5.1%
* Q2 2024: -4.3%
* Q1 2024: 0.5%

International:

* Q4 2024: -2.1%
* Q3 2024: -3.2%
* Q2 2024: 0.7%
* Q1 2024: 7.6%

Overall, worldwide vehicle rental revenue is down by -3.4% yoy in FY 2024. Big drop compared to the 20.6% increase in FY 2023 or the 56% increase in FY 2022.

From a profitability perspective (EBIT**DA),** things look raw (to say the least). Just look at the trend below. By the way, that's earnings **BEFORE** depreciation.

https://preview.redd.it/yfum8bbvz5xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf99de745f069c965942d41baf0997f2631b31c

When taking into account DEPRECIATION, things look even more raw.

https://preview.redd.it/7rvznrpb06xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d37b1679a22a66b3926e71d7b03328b10d05086

What's the company doin' about this?

**Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right** strategy --> Back to Basis roadmap

Here's a summary:

|Metric|Year-End 2023|Year-End 2024|Target by YE 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|% of fleet ≤ 1 year old|(not disclosed)|60 %|Substantially complete rotation\*|
|Average cap cost of “risk” vehicles vs. existing|(not disclosed)|\~ 30 % lower|Maintain or improve cost advantage|
|Vehicles sold (Q4)|\~ 30,000|100,000 (+ 230 %)|—|
|Depreciation per unit (DPU), net|Guided $350–375|Actual $347 (**gross**)|< $300/month/unit|

On the **Buy Right** strategy. From the Q4 earnigns call:

>*Our risk vehicles … have an average cap cost almost 30% lower than our existing fleet of model year ’22 through ’24 car buys*

In plain English: Compared to the cars they bought in 2022–2024, the new cars (for 2025) cost 30% less on average.

>*We've got committed model year '25 buys locked in at the economics that foot to that \[sub-$300 DPU\] metric*

What is the DPU: depreciation per vehicle per month. In plain English: how much a vehicle looses value per month due to depreciation.

The thing is. $300 DPU is not a sneeze. Take a look at the DPU trend below.

https://preview.redd.it/29pt5fsn16xe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dca0fbbb37791873434c76c3bac93f67ce890b15

Does that look scary? It seems that the depreciation in the US is way more pronounced than in the EU.

Here's the deal, baby! The median of the ""total DPU"" since 2019 was **$253**. Things changed after the pandemic, you may say. Fair enough. Here is the median of the ""total DPU"" (total meaning both US and International cars) since Q1 2022: **$284.**

Let me be clear. The target of <$300 per month is only bringing back the company to the base line after the pandemic. That baseline is still high compared to pre-pandemic levels.

On their **Hold Right** strategy: A car’s biggest value drop happens in the first 1–2 years. But if Hertz keeps cars very new (fleet mostly < 1 year old), depreciation per month becomes predictable and lower.

From the earnings call:

>As of year-end 2024, over 60 % of our fleet was comprised of vehicles 1 year old or less.

On the **Sell Right** strategy:

In Q4 2024 alone, they sold 100,000 vehicles, compared to just 30,000 in Q4 2023. Less than 10% sold in auctions (lower prices) and they are prioritizing their retail selling channel (higher prices due to add-ons, like financing).

Management is bullish on tariffs:

>If tariffs … increase new car prices, the counterbalance is likely residual values will go up, which will help our business model

I am not. Here is why: Trump is chickening out of sectoral tariffs on autos after CEOs complained. Check recent news on this topic. I am seemingly now allowed to post links.

# The Bear Case

Here is a strong pillar of my bear case:

Take a look at utilization rates over past few years. Notice the seasonality, which is 100% normal.

https://preview.redd.it/bcf0lr3436xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b0a2aebc330d934d53fae0d818fc911c4e1cfdb

WTF is the utlization rate? In plain English: how much a vehicle is being rented (i.e. generating $$$) during the quarter.  80% utilization rate means that 4 out of 5 days, the car is rented out. Not bad, right! The trend looks fine. Here is the yoy variation in utilization rates:

* Q4 2024: 1.3%
* Q3 2024: -1.2%
* Q2 2024: -2.4%
* Q1 2024: -1.3%

The trend (when adjusted for seasonality) is flat, which is great... or is it?

Take a look at the trend in total revenue per transaction day. In other words, how much HTZ is makin' per vehicle per day, on average, during the quarter, both in Americans and Intl.

https://preview.redd.it/7hyrezlc46xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ecfb3a484a174c1df90c2b79f018844b9b16d45

The trend looks raw.

Here's the thing: to keep the same utilization rates (in other words, to keep their vehicles rented out), the company has to lower the daily rates to maintain demand. Here is the seasonally adjusted variation in revenue per transaction day in 2024:

* Q4 2024: -2.4%
* Q3 2024: -0.7%
* Q2 2024: -3.2%
* Q1 2024: -6.9%

Speaking of raw trends, here is a chart showing interest expenses over the past few years:

https://preview.redd.it/xlk85vyg56xe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0821c8360c6c43e7b94c95bc8bd2133570ba4115

Here is the yoy variation in interest payments:

* Q4 2024: 19.3%
* Q3 2024: 9.3%
* Q2 2024: 26.1%
* Q1 2024: 33.3%

Here is an interesting chart of the nearest debt maturities:

https://preview.redd.it/xxvnuo6f66xe1.png?width=1989&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a60c34a893796fb3625247abe615fb04ddf7e0

# The Pershing Square Deal

Bill Ackman's fund owns now 4.1% of HTZ. Possibly the first step of an activist campaign to influence management on the direction of the company. (when they reach 5% ownership, the fund must file either a 13D or 13G).

Morgan Stanley teased the AI case for the company. To my eyes, BS. Here is why:

It seems that the Street is bullish on autonomous vehicles (i.e. robotaxis) requiring ""downstream fulfillment infrastructure"" that could be implemented at HTZ rental locations.

Look. Hype works when the S&P 500 is hitting all time highs. Now, hype it's not a good bet. Tesla's robotaxies are operating on Tesla's own infrastructure. Same for Waymo. Hertz would need to burn a lot in CapEx to adapt their rental locations to accommodate robotaxis' operations. Not bullish, in my view.

Here is another reason I am sketched out by the rally. And this, is the final pillar of my bear case:

According to Bloomberg, Hertz Global Holdings is looking to raise $500M through additional debt **or equity offering.** This is key. This is a rumor. It's not officially announced by the company. There is no 8-K filed yet.

My point: if the company dilutes investors now that the share price is up (which is quite common, just look at quantum stocks in Q4 last year), that will lead to a selloff. Simple as that.

LYB makes chemicals internationally, sold to businesses who use them make a variety of products.  These chemicals are commodities where global market sets price, and demand is subject to economic cycles. The CEO describes the current period as biggest cyclical downturn in his career.

For operation in the Americas, access to cheaper feedstock combined with vertical integration bolsters margins relative to other chemical producers in the market in the following way:

Step 1: LYB takes cheap US shale gas and uses it to make propylene and ethylene in their cracker plants.

Step 2: Uses this propylene and ethylene as inputs to make multiple chemicals it sells to other businesses:

1. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) plastics - ""O&P Americas segment""
2. Basket of interrelated chemicals e.g. propylene oxide, etc. - ""I&D segment"" (which also has international operations)
3. Licenses some of its specialized processes in making these chemicals to other businesses- ""Technology segment""

**What I'm thinking:**

Industry is in cyclical downtown, combined with recent tariff-related economic uncertainty, has suppressed share price.  However, it was noted in Q1 call that tariffs affect 10% of their business, and they expect cyclicality to eventually recover.  Meanwhile management is being disciplined with cash.  At current stock price of $59.66 one is getting a 8.95% dividend, while LYB stock historically has traded around $85-$100 levels.  Perhaps one could buy low and be generously paid to wait for share price recovery.  What are your thoughts on this company?",1745625462.0

1k7th50,GDPNow Atlanta FED Q2 Recession ✨⚡️THUNDERDOME⚡️✨,770,224,"TL;DR: The official government predictions that predict whether we are in recession or not will come out April 30th. GDP Numbers for Q1 are reported and estimates for Q2 are released from April 30th by the BEA and Atlanta Fed. Q2 estimates will be negative because of the 90 day tariff extension and the market hasn’t realized it yet. 

#GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

Chances are, we have been in a recession since January 1st. This will become very apparent after April 30th. Not because of the Q1 QDP report, but because of the Q2 estimates that begin to be released that day. Current expectations are for slight growth in Q2, but there’s good reason to think otherwise and news hits that GDP will detract, it will bring the market down and fit the definition of a recession that is two quarters of negative GDP growth. 

##What has already happened:

At the end of last February, aka the last market high, the [Atlanta Fed rapidly started dropping their GDP Now estimates](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx), why? Because of the sharp spike in imports to the United States to preempt Trump's tariffs. That’s the moment the market started taking Trump's tariff seriously and acting on it. From that moment, we knew we would have at least one negative quarter of GDP growth, but it takes two to tango and as long as Q2 wouldn't be negative as well, we would avoid fitting the definition of a recession. From this info, we know that when tariffs are announced for a future date, firms will import ahead of time to get around it. 



##What is yet to happen:

What would cause Q2 to be negative if importers already imported everything ahead of liberation day? Well the only thing I can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of April, say- I don't know ***90 days***, like exactly before the end of Q2 so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again. Like specifically if I had to cause a recession, that'd be my play book. Announce tariffs to kill one quarter of GDP growth, and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next. Genius.

Here’s what I expect is going to happen that hasn’t been priced in yet: importers are going to create another large net export trade deficit to get around the 90 day trigger, consumption will decrease as Americans brace for a recession, and we are going to have a second negative quarter despite all expectations. 


##What it means:

Why is fitting the actual definition of a recession bad? (you ask, retardedly) Because it kills the fucking vibes. Consumers react to what's in the news. These things compound on each other, consumption is another component of GDP. If one quarter is down 3% and the next quarter is +0.1%? Recession narrowly avoided a la the 2022 Vibesession. The next quarter is down -0.1%? We're cooked, because that's when news agencies go from nebulous articles about ""the possibly of a recession"" to ""freak the fuck out and panic sell everything, we are officially in a recession right now"". Technically the soonest the government would officially call a recession that started in 2025 is July 30th, 30 days after Q2 ends when the reports get dropped. 

Here's the flip side, if the GDP estimates *don't* go negative throughout Q2, it will take a long time for another recession risk to form. The two negative quarters have to be consecutive to meet the definition. There would have to be *another* two quarters of negative GDP growth to kill that. So if numbers don't look bad after April 30th, bulls are gonna win this one. 

Here's how I'll be wrong: importers sit on their ass and don't import before the 90 day extension is up, because they already filled warehouses in Q1 or they just don't care. OR, foreign countries begin ""kissing his ass"", a deal gets struck and the tariffs come down. OR, a cosmic particle strikes the neurons in Trump's head like a transistor flipping in a Super Mario speedrun and he takes them all down. 

##How we will know:

Here's the key part of how all this gets called. The Bureau of Economic Analysis [releases their first official GDP report](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule) for a quarter 30 days after that quarter ends, and the Atlanta FED begins releasing their estimates for the current quarter 30 days after it begins. That means **April 30th** is the day of days when we will know the final numbers for Q1, which will be bad, and we will know the estimates for Q2. **If the Q2 estimates are bad on April 30th, that is the same as the Atlanta Fed predicting a recession.** This is what we don't know, but based on how importers reacted last time to change in tariffs, and how the Fed reacted to them, I would imagine this brings down GDP estimates. 

##Assumptions I am making:

-The definition of a recession as two quarters of negative GDP growth is a good and accurate definition, and that people will freak out when we are projected to meet that definition. 

-A large amount of trade deals won’t get made in the next quarter. 

-Importers will create a large trade deficit that brings down GDP because of the 90 day tariff extension. 

-The market hasn’t already priced this in. 

There’s plenty of reasons to expect one of those assumptions to be wrong. Do your own DD. Tell me how I’m wrong below.

1k7s0er,Short-term BNTX opportunity,9,22,"Today BNTX tanked \~20% because SMMT's (down \~40%) results for their drug Ivonescimab wasn't as good as expected. 

My naive reading is that this BNTX selloff was a knee jerk reaction because they also have a similar drug in the pipeline.

However, according to this press release ([https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-present-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across-mrna-and](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-present-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across-mrna-and)), BNTX will release results at a conference **THIS WEEKEND** related to that drug **BNT327**

They frame these as **HIGHLIGHTS** so I don't think they would be negative. That actually seems great for BNTX as their competitor SMMT's drug didn't perform to expectations.

**Highlights of BioNTech’s oncology programs to be presented at AACR 2025:**

* BioNTech will present preclinical data characterizing the mode of action of **BNT327**. BNT327 is an investigational next-generation bispecific antibody combining PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with VEGF-A neutralization. BNT327 showed a high binding affinity to PD-L1 and VEGF-A and efficient blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling. Anti-tumor activity superior to single PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or anti-VEGF-A treatment was observed in multiple tumor models. 
* First data for the combination of **BNT327 with various ADC candidates**, which are being jointly developed by BioNTech and Duality Biologics (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. (“DualityBio”), will be presented. The presentation will include preclinical evaluation of BNT327 plus ADCs, showing inhibition of tumor growth that is superior to each candidate alone. Further, early clinical data of the ongoing global Phase 1/2 trial ([NCT05438329](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05438329)) of BNT327 in combination with **BNT325/DB-1305**, a TROP2-targeting ADC candidate, including safety and early efficacy

BNTX is presenting their results on **Sunday, Apr 27** and **Tue, Apr 29**. If the results are good as promised, the stock should shoot up 20%+

1k7rfsw,"Forgetting SPY, let Not Mineral Guy help you to get your money",7,4,"TLDR: I suck Minerals daily instead of weeds, so I buy UUUU

For faster introduction, I am Not Mineral Guy but I just like Minerals so here is my DD related to UUUU and why it becomes a monster in minerals after next few month:

1). Executive Order:

Today (04/24), the White House released a new[ Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/). To summarize it, this EO is to focus on domestic minerals, and wants to fasten the permitting process for domestic supply chain. This is good news for UUUU because they have severals project compared to its competitor:

* UUUU has [around 13 projects in total in the US, some are permitted, some are waiting](https://www.energyfuels.com/)
* Its competitor [Cameco only has 3 projects in the US, 4 in the Canada](https://www.cameco.com/businesses/uranium-operations)
* Denison Mines only has mines i[n Canada](https://denisonmines.com/projects/overview/), which is in Athabasca Basin

Comparing to the other competitors, UUUU is much lower valuation (around 800M-1B) compared to the other. So I believe we have a room to run to at least $7-$8 soon.  
  
2). Company news:

Today, the Company also assigned the new CFO and will have the earnings call in May. On April 17, they have said that as long as the US government funding, they can substitute the China's critical minerals imports. With this new change of CFO and the upcoming earnings, I believe they are prepared for the expansion of the company

3). I like minerals:  
This is the last reason, I like minerals so I hold it and play with it

My strategy is to purchase 5-10 DTE options, based on a careful mix of DD, Donie Truths, and gut instinct. I always give my thesis time to play and I ALWAYS take my profits - I never let the thesis fully play out, if I earn $5K+ unrealized profit on a play, I start planning the exit trade. There are plenty of trades that could have been monstrous if I held to maturity, but there were also a few that would have wiped me out if I held.

Also high volatility, means you pay higher premiums. Please be wary of this - some of these 1-2 DTE options I see for break evens that would be 3 or 4 standard deviation events in a normal market irk me out. You can easily fall victim to significant Theta (time value decay) if your positions don’t leave you with enough time to exit.

For example, on a recent trade I bought 200 x GLD $300 PUTS expiring May 9th on April 24th. I felt Gold was in an overbought position, reviewing the 1-month chart, RSM, and again using gut instinct and Donnie vibes that have recently ushered in a new market optimism. The next day, GLD drops to 2%+ to $301 at the open and I sell for a $30k+ profit.

I’ll continue to post my journey on the road to a Milli… that’s my exit strategy, after I get to $1M I’m writing iron condors for premiums and FIRING away.

1k71mlh,Meta cuts jobs at its Reality Labs division,39,8,"​Meta has laid off an unspecified number of employees within its Reality Labs division as part of ongoing restructuring efforts. 

The job cuts primarily affect teams in Oculus Studios, Meta's in-house game development unit responsible for creating content for their Quest virtual reality (VR) headsets. 

Employees working on projects such as the VR fitness game Supernatural are among those impacted. 

A Meta spokesperson stated that these changes aim to enhance operational efficiency and focus on developing future mixed reality experiences for an expanding user base. 

As of December 31, 2024, Meta's global workforce numbered 74,067. Notably, Reality Labs posted a $5 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to the restructuring decisions. Despite this, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains steadfast in his support for the company’s long-term strategy centered on augmented and virtual reality technologies. ​

These layoffs come amid continued challenges in Meta's hardware and gaming sectors. While sales of Meta's smart glasses with Ray-Ban have grown faster than the company expected, Quest headset sales have continued to struggle. 

The latest Quest 3S, released last fall, is currently on sale for roughly 10 percent off in some configurations",1745524306.0

On the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations. Shanghai Pudong round trip to Dallas-Fort Worth is a common route that is seing drastic decrease for AAL.

A downturn in both leisure and business tourism leads to reduced hotel occupancy rates, lower room pricing, and decreased revenue, particularly in tourist-centric cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and New York City.

Companies/stock potentially affected: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. 

Tenet Healthcare (THC) – Dallas, TX maybe affcted too. They owns hospitals and medical centers, some of which attract foreign patients for medical tourism.

Carnival Corporation (CCL) – Miami, FL, world’s largest cruise line, heavily dependent on international tourists, including Chinese travelers.

Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) – Miami, FL, same as Carnival, with an even more aggressive focus on Asia-Pacific expansion, including China-based cruise itineraries.

Airbnb: decrease of international travel and domestic travellers worrying about host calling Ice on them for deportation , just because why not?
Many Buffalo/NY small businesses rely on Canadian spending. If revenue drop, they cant pay rent, if they cant pay rent, landlords cant service mortage debt. More businesses will close like in covid or after covid.

Lennar Corporation (LEN) – Miami, FL, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S has lot of Chinese buyers: Florida (and Texas) have been targets for foreign real estate investment, particularly by Chinese nationals seeking EB-5 visas or U.S. property. So real estate may be affected too, in this case, may be it will relieve pressure on prices, not sure. But for REITS (real estate investment trusts) that owns properties leased to Hotels and restaurants or Malls or international student housing that depends on international travellers or Transit/transcient business, trouble are ahead in all major US Cities. 

Event Spaces & Convention Centers: A reduction in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) activities weakens demand for event spaces and the surrounding businesses that support them. ALL major hotels brand affected.

Diversified REITs: These entities, with portfolios spanning retail, hotel, and mixed-use developments in major gateway cities, face indirect impacts from the downturn in tourism and international student presence: Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), BXP, Inc. (BXP)

The third financed asset in size for all major banks after government bonds and other bank is real estate ( commercial and residential)

also, if all foreign countries keep rejecting boeing planes delivery like china, it is the whole aerospace sector that is going down with all of the small industries and SMEs that their business model feeds.

Well no wonder T is saying now: we are discussing with China, but they said: heuuu, no we are not discussing yet. remove all tariffs first, holder of negotiation power is obvious. So until all of this is fixed and factoring at least few months of starring, the crash is coming.

Andurand trades oil, copper and other commodities, which have been whipsawed in April as Trump’s global tariff agenda threatened to wreck economic growth. Copper suffered a weekslong selloff before recouping some of the declines.


Oil prices crashed to a four-year low below $60 a barrel in London on April 9, days after Trump unveiled his tariffs and OPEC+ announced a larger-than-expected supply increase. Futures have subsequently rebounded amid signs that physical crude markets are still tight, trading near $67 a barrel on Thursday. But they still remain about 10% lower from the end of last month.


With no set risk limits, it isn’t uncommon for Andurand’s Discretionary Enhanced fund to see such swings in its returns. Over the last three years, the strategy has been through double-digit gains and losses.”

1k70ero,Everything about Google's earnings tonight,251,101,"Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. 

So for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.

**The Chart**

From a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. 

**Earnings**

For Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.

**Cloud Services**

For those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.

The second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.

I'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.

**Tariffs** 

One of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.

At this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.

I think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.

**Price Targets**

Amid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.

Guggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.

I mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.

If we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.

**In the news**

A federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.

There’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Alphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.

Separately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.

**What now?**

Alphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",1745521349.0

1k6kg0r,+$162k UGL Gain,73,39,"When the specter of tariffs began to take shape, I started loading up on safe-haven assets as a short-term hedge against any volatility in international affairs.  I took out a small position in UGL and a much larger position in GLD, both of which track the gold market.  Most of my purchases were made in late February and early March.  I added some more to those positions in April to take advantage of the upward momentum.

I managed to time the local peak in the spot price of gold rather well.  I closed my UGL position for a six-figure gain.  I am paring my GLD position and will likely be realizing a seven-figure gain once I am finished selling.

I am not quite sure when I will completely rotate out of the latter position, though.  There are a few reasons for this.  Foremost, I still see significant uncertainty with regards to international trade.  I do believe that, in the short term, this will continue to cause the price of gold to rise against a number of currencies.  It is also entirely possible that we could witness a decline and then an aggressive melt up in the price of gold if negotiations break down substantially and the equities market is forced to digest what is effectively a trade embargo against either one or more countries.  For the contrarian view, we are either one tweet, wayward comment, or press conference away from the equities market rallying and the price of gold being temporarily depressed.  All of this uncertainty is additionally being driven by one individual who folds at the slightest bit of resistance.

For those who are curious about a follow-up play, I added to my holdings of BRK-A with the proceeds from these trades.  I'll be buying more BRK-A after I close my GLD position.",1745472058.0
1k6iede,$TGT – Target is a Sitting Duck. I'm Buying Puts and You Should Too.,725,534,"The bull case for Target is dead. I’m loading up on puts like it’s 2008 and this place sells CDOs. Here’s why:

TL;DR:
Consumer spending is falling. Foot traffic is down. Earnings are flat. They're getting wrecked by Walmart, Amazon, and Costco. Their DEI pivot backfired and pissed everyone off. Tariffs are incoming. Margins are about to get smoked. I'm buying puts, and it’s looking real good.

Financials are soft:

Q4 2024 revenue: $30.92B (beat, but barely)

Full-year 2024 net sales: $106.6B, down from $107.4B in 2023

Full-year EPS: $8.86, down from $8.94

Stock is already down 20% over the past year

You can’t spin that into a growth story. Flat is the new down, especially with macro pressure.

People aren’t shopping there anymore:

10 straight weeks of declining in-store foot traffic

Cutting back DEI stuff alienated both sides of the aisle

Costco is scooping up their customers and their lunch

Curbside and online aren’t saving them like they used to

Tariffs + Recession = Profit Implosion:

Trump’s new tariffs are hammering imports from China, Mexico, and Canada

Target has to either eat the cost or pass it to consumers. Both suck.

Their CFO straight-up said consumer spending is cautious and soft

GDP forecast for Q1 2025 is negative. Recession vibes confirmed.

They’re getting crushed from all sides:

Walmart is cheaper and better positioned

Amazon dominates online

Costco is recession-proof and more beloved

Target is stuck in the middle, with no clear value prop

The trade:

Buying more Jan 2026 $70P and $65P

IV still reasonable for now

Tariffs + weak macro + earnings misses = real downside

If this cracks below $90 again, it could fall off a cliff.

Final thought:

This isn’t just a bearish play. This is a breakdown in identity. Target’s stuck trying to please everyone and is failing to please anyone. Consumers are broke, boycotting, and buying bulk from Costco. Their pricing isn't competitive. Their foot traffic is drying up. Their margins are at risk. And their best-case scenario is flat sales. Not exactly a growth story.

Airlines and Hospitality are high fixed cost Industries( the one you still incur with or without revenue); unless you are operating on a very limited service business model, Low contribution margin and high fixed cost are bad for even small variations in load factor and occupancy rates. Break even point is around 60 to 65 percent annualized load factor or occupancy rates for low cost, higher for middle to upper scale. Airlines flagship survive only because of national pride and government involvement . Also, These industries are good proxies to assess if we are in recession, the depth and if we are recovering. By all adjacent metrics ( skilled/quality mix, the one that pay high price, i.e business customers and meeting incentive conference exhibitions) and leisure customer ( low paying) we are already in recession. It will fully show in other hospitality companies, airlines and other industries in Q2 earnings. You may want to check the latest Management discussion and analysis of these companies ( and possible that they stay silent or conservative to avoid stock beating) we are going for a bumpy ride, tariffs or not tariffs unless the US customer can survive with The USA in isolation. Inflation up because of tariffs and unemployment up soon; where is monetary policy going? Stock market, for all stocks may be except nvidia, not enough sustainable catalyst to go in the middle of the 52 weeks range, overall more downside than upside. Stock are going up? sure, option cleaning, just dancing .Update after q2 and q3 earnings release..for full impact. 
Overall, from the Top, a very very bigly bad chess, where the second piece moved was the king, and the king hasn’t stopped moving since in all direction, and the dragon is secretly smiling 

for the redditor challenging the statement that airlines operate in mainly fixed cost industry ( you still have to pay aircraft lease, airport fees, routine maintenance and maintenance capex, air route rights, craft parking and tarmac fees, some salaries lines will stay fixed), do your due diligence, this link is for you https://www.spsairbuz.com/story/?id=964

1k6dp17,Checking the halving of Teslas Capital Expenditures together,8,73,"**Found the mistake: The accounting rules for the IRS are different than for public financial statements of US companies. Oooooffff, thought i got them**

**Can be locked now.**



For full disclosure:  
Yeah, i lost money on shorting this damn stock.

But with this in mind, i got angry at the the shitshow and am now trying to understand the story of how it is possible that Teslas capital expenditures halved within a year and i would like your help with this, since i am not firm enough in the matter to know if i'm missing something.

I already asked a cousin of mine at the german 'Finanzamt', the equivalent of the IRS to give me his take on it. He has yet to answer me.

I particularly need your help in understanding how american capital allowances work and how long they are stretched for different items.

Maybe i'm wrong and this is a nothingburger. I dunno.

So, here is the thing:  
I got a serious problem with the way it's supposed to be possible that, on one hand the 'Abschreibungen' (Google translates this as 'Capital Allowances' to me) of a company that in the last five to seven years has built most of it's biggest production facilities and the way these are noted in their books.

As i understand it, most of the capital allowances for the biggest items Tesla has to buy for the factories are, at least here in Germany, written off in a time span of 5 to 25 years, with the wide majority of items being written of after 7 for a lot of machinery, but expensive items like buildings often taking 20 to 25 years for the writeoff.

If i understand it correctly, these costs appear as capital expenditures in Teslas books.

Given that Tesla practically just built these factories, most of the capital expenditures should still be running.

How is it possible that these costs simply 'disappear' from one year to the next?  
I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept that i'm not qualified to make assumptions over fraud here. But i'd really like to be presented a compelling argument on this.

I don't understand how this should be possible, unless Tesla sold off major parts of their facilities and other inventory and then leased it back or something.

Maybe i'm just stupid. But please explain this to me.

Edit: I'm not sure if i got lost in translation here, but again, Google translated the word ""Abschreibung"" to me as capital allowance.

So let me explain: If you are a business and buy certain, mostly expensive items, you can not simply write the costs for that into your books.  
Rather, you have to look up a long list of items and check the time the IRS gives you to use these until, theoretically, you have to buy a new one.

This process is called ""Abschreibung"" in German. Maybe there is another term for this in English.  
Would be helpful if someone translates this correctly.

Edit 2: So, one commenter noted that the terms used in the US are ""Depreciation, amortization and impairment"".  
I think those are not the terms used by the IRS and accountants, but they explain why capital allowance exists.

Since an item can still be sold for a certain value for a certain time after it's bought, it does not immediately constitute costs, even if already paid. Authorities instead calculate the costs of that item by a theoretical meassure in which it 'depreciates' in value when used for the production process, which is time.  
I guess the IRS, in the same way as our ""Finanzamt"", has a long list of items, from computers, over cars, to buildings, that have a specific number of years to be cleared from the books as costs.

If a building, for example, has 25 years to be cleared, it means that, once bought, this building will show up as capital expenditure for 25 years after.

So: It takes years to clear these from Teslas books.  
How then can half these costs be gone within a year?

1k62347,Bessent Says No Unilateral Offer From Trump to Cut China Tariffs,1664,316,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump hasn’t offered to take down US tariffs on China on a unilateral basis.

There has been no unilateral offer from Trump to reduce tariffs on China, Bessent told reporters Wednesday in answering questions after a keynote speech at an Institute of International Finance event in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday had said that US tariffs “will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” and that he didn’t see the need to “play hardball” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Bessent said that the Trump administration is looking at multiple factors with regard to China beyond just tariffs — including non-tariff barriers and government subsidies. He also said that the strongest relationship between Washington and Beijing is at the top, and that there was no timeframe for engagement. He said that a full rebalancing of trade might take two to three years.

Trump said separately on Wednesday that the US is going to have a fair deal with China.

The Treasury chief also said that the US and India are “very close” on a trade agreement. He reiterated that a satisfactory arrangement doesn’t mean an actual trade document — signaling, as he has before, that initial deals with trading partners will be a broad framework rather than a detailed trade agreement.",1745422253.0

today was another green day. hsi closed up 2.37% at 22072.62 and hscei added 2.08% to 8116.28. big tech led again. xiaomi jumped 7%, baba climbed 5%. tencent and meituan got good flows too. byd electronic 00285 (i always put the ticker since people mix it up with byd) was up almost 4% so it's getting there

i’ve started scaling down. closed baba calls today. xiaomi probably getting sold tomorrow if it opens green. still holding some of byd electronic 00285 and lenovo. both still have space if hsi holds but i’m not pressing those. hsi feels stretched. not calling a top but i wouldn't be shocked if it starts chopping or fading soon. it doesn't feel clean anymore

but, some of the other major names like tencent and baba still might push a little more but nothing like the setups we had one or two weeks ago. that cheap entry window was clear. now it's more about managing the rest of the position

this move’s headline driven not flow driven. the big story about trump saying 145% china tariffs are too high and hinting at a cut to the 50 to 65% range dropped just before the us open. that drove the bounce in the us. asia hasn’t really traded it yet. we’ll see that overnight

wall street journal reported the white house is actively looking at cutting those tariffs to cool things down. treasury backed that, said the current structure can’t last. markets are leaning toward talks coming but nothing is set yet. this rally is built on hope, not inflows

also saw a few headlines about india's gst council meeting possibly being delayed to late may or june (tariff impact?). that could slow down some tax reform momentum. not directly tied to hong kong but still relevant for regional risk tone

mainland china didn’t really follow today. csi300 was flat. the buying’s still concentrated. hong kong’s getting the lift but it’s not spreading across the region

My POCs are freaking out. One POC said their company is figuring out the feasibility of moving warehouses to other countries to avoid supply chain risk. One company told me their customers are calling them asking where their orders are–the packages are all being held in US ports until the customers ***pay the tariffs for the goods directly.*** Yes, you read that right. These companies are gonna lower revenue guidance by 30%+

Even if Trump and Xi agree to lower tariffs substantially (which seems unlikely to me – Trump has been consistently talking about tariffs on China for decades), I'm not sure how much of the damage can be walked back. Once a company has a freak out about supply chains and tariffs they're going to take action to mitigate risks in case orange face does it again. And there's no chance in hell they're going to be hiring in this kind of risky environment.

I think we're headed for years of negative real GDP growth. Besides unemployment from the retail sector, we're going to have million+ government works laid off by DOGE, and small to medium tech companies are going to lose contracts. (Who's gonna keep paying Hubspot or Monday a few hundred grand a year when GDP growth is negative)

Not much looks investable in this environment. The only thing I like are gold miners (GDX, GDXJ). Even if gold takes a healthy haircut here, the miners are priced as if gold is at like $2000 an ounce, not $3000. These are basically companies that turn oil into gold, and in a deep recession, oil prices will also drop.

1k5sxqo,The Market didn't care about Tesla's Earnings. Here's why. TLDR? It's not rigged,6464,643,"Everyone’s tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so here’s what’s actually going on,  and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why?

Short answer: markets don’t just trade the news,  they trade positioning and expectations.

Here’s how it works:

Before earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options,  especially puts,  were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range.

But Tesla didn’t crash. It didn’t even dip. It went up.

So tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. That’s where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an option’s price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If you’re holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways.

Now let’s talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, they’re taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge.

For puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses.

But if the stock doesn’t drop,  or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. That’s a gamma feedback loop.

Add in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad.

But it doesn’t mean the move is real or sustainable.

The big dogs (institutions) haven’t even acted yet. They’ll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesn’t hit until later.

Let’s be real,  this game isn’t just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They don’t just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowd’s behavior before the crowd even makes a move.

If this were as simple as “bad earnings = buy puts,” everyone would be rich. But it’s not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. That’s why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics,  to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. That’s why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because it’s nice to have, but because it’s necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem.

Yeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes,  but that’s gambling. Without context, you’re flipping a coin. 

This wasn’t about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow.  
The market punished the crowded trade, as it always does.

So no, the system isn’t rigged. It’s just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened.

The move is part of a bid to streamline management and rebuild an engineering-driven culture, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. It would be the first major restructuring under new Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm last month.

The cutbacks follow an effort last year to slash about 15,000 jobs — a round of layoffs announced in August. Intel had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, down from 124,800 the previous year.

I was actually doing alright - taking small profits here and there and got this account. I had SPY 515 Puts 4/25 that I sold at a profit then rolled that into SPY 505 Puts for June 30. Bought a random Multifamily housing ETF (REZ) for Oct - bought at ask and instantly was down 50%. NVDA Put was green but held through today, sold some TLT Puts at a profit.

Woke up today to a raging market, then figured to double down into more SPY 500 Puts for sept 19. Bought NEM Puts + CWEB calls just incase.

Part of me wants to just close my eyes and either let this go to zero or look back in June to see if we're alright. Either way, this will be my last time messing with options (unless I do well). How fucked am I for market open?

UPDATE on April 4/23:  
 sold my NEM (gold mining) Puts at a profit, sold my 580 4/30 call for a profit, sold my CWEB 42 call for a profit, and bout in at the top for another SPY 530 and sold a half hour later after it started dropping for a profit.

MY ARGUMENT

I. The Setup No One Sees Coming

You’ve seen this before. Not the chart. The moment. A sharp drop. A confusing headline. Everyone bails. The algorithms freeze. And then, boom - the narrative flips, and everything rips. That’s the setup right now. SPY is down, volatility is up, and everyone’s arguing about tariffs like it’s Econ 101. But underneath that? A $0.14 option is hiding in plain sight. Deep OTM. December expiration. Sitting there like a scratcher ticket no one scratched. This isn’t a normal trade. It’s a cheap swing at a high conviction reversal. The kind of bet that looks dumb right before it doesn’t.

II. Trump Does What Trump Does

Trump negotiates like he’s writing headlines. Go big, go scary, then walk it back and declare victory with a simple tweet. It’s not theory — it’s his playbook: NAFTA, NATO, North Korea, China (round one). Every time: chaos first, deal later. Now he’s back, and he’s swinging tariffs again. The first shot was expected — China. But then he blindsided everyone by going after Canada and Mexico too. Europe followed. Suddenly it wasn’t just a trade policy. It was a global pile-on. But Trump always wants a win. And wins, for him, come fast. If he starts rolling back these tariffs - even if China stays frozen - the market doesn’t need a resolution. It just needs a direction.

III. What the Math Says

As of April 17, 2025, SPY closed at $526. The $760 call expiring December 19 is priced at $0.14. Using a projected mark of $678 and the same moneyness ratio (678/760), the equivalent August 15 strike is $590 and closed at $5.15. That $678 level isn’t fantasy. It’s the pre-tariff SPY close of $612 plus the same 10.8% gain SPY posted over the same stretch last year. At a cost of $0.14 and a value of $5.15, the return is 36x.

IV. The COVID Rebound: Redux

That 2020 move? Everyone remembers it. But instead of a deadly pandemic, it’s a tariff detour that will unwind - no vaccine required - by just two thumbs pecking out a tweet only one man on Earth can - “the tariff war is over - victory is in hand” - DJT. This isn’t a hedge. It’s a shot. A reset bounce puts this $0.14 option in the money with room to run. That’s not moonshot math. That’s just how mispricing works when everyone’s looking the other way. COVID showed us what happens when sentiment flips. This setup’s cheaper, simpler, and it doesn’t need a Fed bazooka or a warp speed cure— just a shift in tone and a headline worth chasing. If you missed out last time – now is your second chance.",1745358211.0

($WEN) (Reposted with Position Screenshots)",37,38,"Everyone likes to make jokes at the expense of some people who are terrible at trading options here. Telling them, ""See ya at Wendy's!"" (For reasons we all know), but what if, that isn't a bad idea?

We all have a Wendy's somewhere in our town, and obviously people are still buying burgers, nuggets, the works, as shown in their sales.

[Sales](https://preview.redd.it/8qncms9s4gwe1.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52b2ad8e9483508434f792314cf52046d821f85)

The share price is at a comfy low P/E of 13, with a lower Forward P/E of 11, which means you're paying close to what the stock is worth as compared to when you look at big tech companies with inflate P/E ratios (Looking at you PLTR and AMD).

Wendy's currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, coming to Dividend yield TTM of 8.01%, which beats the yield of many REITs, and not to mention, treasuries (Why buy treasuries when you can buy Wendy's?)

Next on the menu (Get it?) We have Institutional ownership which makes up 88% of the owned shares. Trian Fund Management and Vanguard are big names with a huge stake in this old American company, it's not likely they are going to cut their stake between considering the dividend yield and their own sunk cost into investing in it.

[Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/s3ie22uv4gwe1.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf01a25de881a2e9b0e679c84ef3610c613d18f)

Lastly, the special sauce. I went to the effort of drawing these lines so you don't have to. I expect to see $WEN between $16-$24 per share within the next 3 years, maintaining their current dividend yield as well (I am expecting a 40% ROI + 8%/Year for 48% after 3 years).

[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/zg15ko965gwe1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d7163eef48a4b80773acfdbf1b3de407d5190f)

  
That being said, you guys are probably thinking...BORING! Where's the moonshot? Why wait that long? Well, I got an answer for you. I personally believe I am overestimating the time it will take to see these numbers. When enough people catch on that Wendy's is a heck of a value play, it's only going to drive the share price up into a upwards snowball, at least until the yield and P/E isn't tempting enough (Like they're Dave Singles).

Anyways, that is my DD for now on $WEN. Opened a position of 4 $14 Calls for June, and bought 36 shares. Going to invest more as I obtain more capital inflow, targeting making this at least 5% of my portfolio within the next 6 months.

But I figure this one is the last truly spicy one left in my portfolio at the moment and I figured I would share it as well.  As a caveat, this is not investment advice.  My overall portfolio is extremely conservative, so I can take some (fairly crazy) flyers here and there to get a bit of alpha.  


I've been (very happily) shorting TSLA in the medium-term.  I can get into the full thesis later if anyone cares (it's not different than a majority of other bear cases on TSLA)  but I started taking positions as soon as Elmo decided giving a Nazi salute was a cool idea.  I like to enter positions with options strategies that are medium to long term (1 month or longer to expiry, a lot of LEAPS usually).  I tend to have a mix of spreads and naked positions.  


With TSLA  I have three positions outstanding.



(1) April 25 2025 200/230 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 69k several months ago.  My original thinking back when I bought it was to close it before the earning tonights.  Thinking about rolling it outwards at least a week, though it's pretty expensive.  If not, I'm also considerng roughly halving it before market close so that I've got my basis back and I'm just playing with house money on tonight's earnings print.



(2) May 16 2025 235/250  Bear Put Vertical - paid about 15k the day after Trump cancelled the tariffs, figuring that the bounce upwards was really overpriced. This is another one I may cut in half.



(3) June 2025 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 200/240 - paid relatively the most for this (40k) last week.  It has a fair bit of time to expiry, so despite the bad pricing, I'm going to let this one ride a bit longer before re-evaluating a trim or closure of the position.  



All together, these open positions are about 125k in cost basis, sitting at around 100k in paper profits.  It's bit more risk than I like given the bizarre price action that TSLA exhibits, even when it missed and even when it gives bad but blurry near team guidance.  On the flip side, I think the fundamental story here is really really bleak.  Elon has to successfully sell investors on some new radical fantasyland project to avoid a bad day tomorrow.  I don't think simply saying ""I'm out of politics and focused on my companies"" is going to cut it.",1745346073.0

1k5b0z2,Everything about Tesla's earnings tonight,193,219,"Tesla is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.

Tesla generally moves ±10%, and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in July 2024. 

For tonight's first-quarter earnings and revenue, from what I've read, it looks like a lot of analysts are *already* predicting poor results. They see see EPS down 9% to 41 cents a share, though more recent forecasts point to a further slide. Revenue should fall a fraction to $21.27 billion, with the sharp consensus pointing to a 7% decline to $19.76 billion. Tesla Q1 consensus earnings projections have come down more than 40% since the end of 2024. The Q1 EPS target was $3.31 just before Tesla's Q4 earnings release.

What's interesting is that in Q4, Tesla's net income was boosted by a recent change in how companies account for holdings of digital currencies. This policy change resulted in an earnings per share add-on of 68 cents in Q4, with a net income increase of $600 million. So the price of corn could actually really influence the results today.

[The company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-market-tesla-deliveries/), down 13% vs. a year earlier and the lowest since Q2 2022. They fell 32.1% vs. Q4's record 495,570 EVs. The bright spot is Tesla China, where sales appeared to edge higher vs. a year earlier, but those tend to be lower margin. U.S. and European sales have tumbled on Musk's brand woes. Tesla also deployed 10.4 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in Q1, down slightly vs. Q4's record 11 GWh but up 156% vs. a year earlier.

I've looked at a few articles regarding EVs, it looks like auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits of 13.1%, compared to 16.4% a year ago. The average selling price per vehicle coming in at $37,910 in Q1, down from $43,790 in Q1 2024.

So this is what I'm expecting for today: As usual, the focus will be on Elon and the earnings call. Tesla is also changing things up and have said ""in addition to posting first quarter results"" it ""will hold a live company update and question and answer"" session. What this means is anybody's best guess. He in the past has repeatedly said earnings calls are not for product announcements. Could this mean he'll give significant details on the new affordable vehicle? Or could it be similar to the recent all-hands company meeting where he told employees to hold onto their Tesla stock, touting the future of artificial intelligence and robotics?

In any case, I'm more-so interested to see if he sticks to his forecast for unsupervised, self-driving ride hailing in Austin this June, any details about the ""affordable"" vehicle, if he sees delivery growth in 2025 after a weak Q1 and sluggish start to April and what are his plans around his work with the Trump White House. Honestly all this Trump stuff has seemingly [hurt sales](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-deliveries-drop-13-amid-backlash-ceo-elon/story?id=120412167) and dropped the stock. But there isn't really much we can know about the precise impact on Tesla’s bottom line until tonight. 

It's already been reported that Tesla will delay its upcoming ""affordable"" EV by at least three months. Tesla had said it planned production of a lower-cost vehicle by mid-year, but various reports had suggested it would come in late 2025 or 2026. The latest report said production will start in the U.S., followed by China and Europe. They have not given any details about the EV, but multiple reports have said it'll be a stripped-down Model Y rather than a new form factor, like a hatchback.

I honestly think he needs to leave government and be a full-time CEO for Tesla. Right now his temporary status as a government employee expires next month, so he will face questions about his plans during the call. He really needs to lay out the timeline/hard facts around the rollout of autonomous vehicles and robotics over the next 6-12 months. I want answers on when the new lower cost vehicle will hit the production line. Honestly, if he chooses to stay with the government it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Not good. 

In addition to this, rival automakers saw huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD, has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. So with this, I'm considering puts or a put spread. Considering the stock is up 6%, puts are at a discount now. Since the stock usually goes up or down 10%, I would target the 230 or 225 strike price with 4/25 exp date. We also have Google earnings on Thursday, so I'm going to be looking at that as well.",1745340240.0

I stand before you today not as a financial advisor, but as a herald of loss. Not to chart a course toward generational wealth, but to declare our sacred mission: to baghold together, until the bitter end.

We meet not in a moment of market clarity, but in the chaos of zero-DTEs and all-in YOLOs. In the last four weeks, we’ve bought calls on halted meme stocks, averaged down on AI pennies, and convinced ourselves that the tariff pause was bullish - even as futures bled red.

If this capsule of our regression teaches us anything, it’s that the regard trader - in his pursuit of gains and validation - will not be swayed by logic, risk management, or reality.

Some will ask:
Why go all in on a weekly call with no hedge?
Why buy the dip before it dips harder?
Why sit in the Wendy’s dumpster, watching red candles, hoping for Powell to blink?

We choose to baghold - not because we can, but because we must.

Because we are already deep in the call.
Because our average is trash, our liquidity is gone, and a bounce is the only thing standing between us and ruin.

Let every institution know - algo or whale - that WallStreetBets will bear any theta decay, ride any gamma wave, and misinterpret any macro signal, to do what no sane trader dares: stay the course, even as the account hits zero.

We do not act with caution, but with conviction.
Not with models - but with vibes.
Not guided by analysts - but by charts drawn in MS Paint at 2AM.

Because that is who we are.
That is what we now applaud.

Thank you.
And may God have mercy on our open positions.",1745324910.0

**TL;DR:** Trump is making a big show of tariffs, but when the dust settles, Canada will remain America’s closest trade partner. MTW is stupid cheap.

Thesis:

• **Housing demand:** Their cranes are *critical* for U.S. and Canadian multifamily construction. Housing shortages aren’t going away — we have to build. 

• **Cash:** They have positive free cash flow and reasonable reserves. Unless they burned through it since their last 10K, they can take another year or more of punishment.

• **Tariffs are overblown:** Strong U.S. ties, Pittsburgh manufacturing, and growing footprint in Africa/Europe help diversify away from Canada risk. Accelerated orders after April 2nd could actually offset some of the Tariff impacts. 

**Caveat:** If their cash position tanked since the last 10K, my thesis crumbles. I expect short-term volatility. I’m DCA’ing and using bullish puts when spreads are fat.

1k4qcye,Upcoming Philip Morris (NYSE: PM),20,28,"# Fundamental Overview: 

Philip Morris International (PM) has delivered solid financial results in recent quarters, underpinned by growth in both traditional combustibles and next-generation smoke-free products.

**Recent Earnings Trend:** 

In 2024, PM consistently beat expectations, with revenue and earnings on an upward trajectory. 

Example: 

1. Q4 2024 net revenues were $9.7 billion (up 7.3% YoY), and adjusted EPS rose 14% YoY to $1.55, topping forecasts. This capped a year in which organic net revenue grew high-single digits and adjusted EPS grew \~9% (constant currency). 
2. Q3 2024 was similarly strong, with revenues of $9.9 billion (+8.4% YoY) and adjusted EPS $1.91 (+14% YoY) beating estimates. 
3. Earlier in 2024, growth was steadier: Q2 saw $9.5 B revenue (+5.6% YoY) and adjusted EPS $1.59 (flat YoY, but +10.6% ex-currency), while Q1 delivered $8.9 B revenue (+9.7%) and adjusted EPS $1.50 (+8.7%). PM has guided Q1 2025 adjusted EPS at $1.58–1.63 (vs. $1.50 in Q1 2024), on revenue of \~$9.1 B (+3% YoY). Notably, the company raised full-year forecasts multiple times last year; it now projects 2025 adjusted EPS of $7.04–7.17, implying \~8–10% growth.

# Business Segments: 

PM has two focus points: traditional cigarettes and smoke-free products is central to its story. Marlboro Cigarettes still contribute significant revenue, and pricing power in this segment has driven gains – in Q4, combustible net revenue grew \~6% organically on high single-digit price increases. 

Now, PMI’s future growth is clearly fueled by smoke-free products (notably the IQOS heated tobacco system and **ZYN nicotine pouches**) now comprise about 40% of total revenues and an even higher share of profit (42% of gross profit in Q4). In 2024, smoke-free net revenues grew at a double-digit pace (+9% YoY in Q4, +14% in Q3), showing people aren't retarded and care about their health. IQOS has \~30.8 million users globally (as of mid-2024), and saw double digit volume growth in the EU and Japan, if Japanese mfs are using it, then it's some good stuff. Heated tobacco unit shipment volumes rose 13%+ in 2024. 

ZYN nicotine pouches are the hottest fucking thing in the US \~50% YoY in 2024. In Q4 alone, US ZYN volume jumped 42% to 165 million cans after PM got rid of supply constraints. Geographically, PM is well diversified: it has strongholds in the EU (Spain and Germany), Asia (Japan’s IQOS market share >29%). The US is now sucking up all the ZYNs (I have one in my mouth right now as I am typing this in class), and PMI has also regained US rights for IQOS as of 2024, giving me and other citizens more stuff to be addicted to. 

# Guidance & Outlook: 

PMI’s management is optimistic heading into 2025. They forecast net revenue growth of \~6–8% and continue to see smoke-free products driving \~10–12% HTU volume growth and an even larger +34–41% surge in ZYN volume this year. This outlook led PM to project 2025 EPS above consensus. PM are pussies and has a track record of conservative guidance and “beat-and-raise” performance, which has investors with a larger boner than after a gas station rhino pill. The company did take a one-time charge in 2024 (Canadian litigation settlement), causing a GAAP loss in Q4, but excluding bullshit like that, PM’s earnings quality is strong.

# What the Wall Street Virgins are Saying:

Wall Street analysts has a positive outlook on PMI, albeit with a range of targets. In recent months, several analysts have hiked their price targets. 

For example: 

1. Citi raised its target to $180 (from $163) while reiterating a Buy, citing the company’s strong growth prospects (smoke-free transformation and earnings momentum). 
2. Morgan Stanley lifted its target to $155 (Overweight) after Q4, highlighting confidence in PMI’s robust 2025 guidance​
3. Stifel went to $160 (Buy), calling Q4 results “the kind we have become accustomed to” – i.e., consistently strong. 
4. UBS raised its target to $120 (from $105) but kept a Sell, showing caution even though PMI’s volume growth and improved currency outlook. But UBS analysts are pussies.

**My positions: 10 x calls $165 strike expiring 04/25**

TL:DR: ZYN good = PM good = Stock go up

1k4oygn,Negative roll yield and reverse split causation,38,13,"""Stay away from widowmaker etfs UVIX, UVXY, SQQQ ,SOXS

Negative roll yield and decay are crucial concepts when dealing with leveraged ETFs like SOXS, SQQQ, UVXY, and UVIX. Here's how they apply:
Negative Roll Yield

Roll yield refers to the return generated when rolling futures contracts forward. It becomes negative when the market is in contango, meaning longer-term futures contracts are more expensive than near-term ones. Since ETFs like UVXY and UVIX track volatility futures, they suffer losses when rolling contracts forward at higher prices. This continuous erosion of value makes them poor long-term investments.
Decay (Beta Slippage)

Decay, also known as beta slippage, affects leveraged ETFs due to their daily rebalancing. These funds aim to provide multiples of daily returns, but compounding effects cause them to lose value over time, especially in volatile markets. For example:

SQQQ (3x inverse Nasdaq-100) suffers decay because daily percentage moves compound negatively.

UVXY and UVIX (leveraged volatility ETFs) experience extreme decay due to volatility drag.

Impact on SOXS, SQQQ, UVXY, and UVIX

SOXS (3x inverse semiconductor ETF) faces decay due to daily rebalancing.

SQQQ loses value over time unless the Nasdaq consistently declines.

UVXY and UVIX suffer the worst decay due to roll yield and leverage.

These ETFs are best used for short-term trading, not long-term holding, due to their structural decay. If you're considering them, it's essential to understand their mechanics to avoid unexpected losses.

UVIX, UVXY, SQQQ , SOXS must reverse split to prevent them from going to "" 0 ""

1k4ooy7,Stephen Miran's idea about tariffs is not black and white as he says...(my thoughts),33,112,"I've read the paper 2 times to really get his points across. I think the paper is a MUST READ not because there is a lot to learn from it, but because you should be prepared what the admin thinks, so get prepared.

I want to discuss one idea from the paper, even though many topics are worth discussing:

He says tariffs are usually paid by the exporting nation (companies in that nation) only if currency is offset by the same percentage as the tariff. Example:

1 - Imported good price is $10 pre trariff ->

2 - Dollar value is up 10%, so that same good now costs $9 ->

3 - Tariff added of 10% for that good now makes it $9.9 (we call it same price basically)

So his point is that tariffs can be offset this way, so consumer pays basically the same price but $1 goes to the treasury, thus exporting nation (company) basically paid the tariff and U.S. gets additional revenue.

I think this is kind of misleading for the reason: Mathematically what he says is true, but **burden is still shared by the consumer and the exporting nation in this case**, not only by exporting nation. Consumer is still ""robbed"" of the opportunity to buy the good for $9 and capitalize from dollar valuation, instead he pays same price and not getting any benefit from it. I understand that possibly this revenue from tariffs will bring some of the taxes down (yet to see?), but not to the point that you would be compensated and still pay $9 for the same product.

He often gives the same example in interviews (there are couple of them) where he compares a house sale. If for example tax of real estate is up by 10%, the seller also ups the value for +10% but buyer does not want to buy, the seller has to sell the house for the original price thus he burdens the cost of the tax because of inelasticity. I think this example is comparing apples to oranges because buyer does not share burden in this case, so he makes a trick that it is the same with tariffs, when in reality consumer is still ""robbed"" of opportunity in the first case, and not in this case.

Now, the next point he makes is that inelasticity makes exporting nation pay the tariff because they don't have anywhere else to sell the product. Even after exporting company squeeze maximum margin just to stay in the market, part of the cost is still shared with the consumer, because consumer would never fully capitalize from squeezing margins even if price is now lower than it previously was.

Final thought, I think it is in the spectrum of who burdens the cost by how much.

Tesla’s “rise on bad earnings” is a dead meme. Those rare pops were driven by hype bombs that aren’t coming this time. Now, with public sentiment in the gutter, no guidance, tariff pain, Elon over-promising fatigue, and Model S/X getting pulled globally… this earnings is a setup for a brutal downside move.

⸻

🧟 “BUT TSLA RISES ON BAD NEWS!” – NOT ANYMORE

Let’s shut this down:
	•	Q4 2024 is the only real exception: Tesla missed both revenue and EPS but rose ~4% only because Elon teased a June robotaxi launch and new low-cost model plans.
	•	That bounce came after hours, only after the call—purely driven by forward guidance.
	•	Without those surprise announcements? TSLA always drops on a miss.

There is no consistent historical pattern of Tesla going up on bad earnings without major forward-looking hype. That’s not a trend. That’s luck + hopium.

⸻

⚠️ THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT – IN THE WORST WAY

1. No Guidance, No Hype, No Lifeline
	•	No Model 2.
	•	No robotaxi demo.
	•	No solid FSD timeline.
	•	Last call? Elon basically said “we’re not giving forward guidance anymore.”

2. Elon Over-Promising = Worn Out
	•	Promised Full Self-Driving “next year” since 2016. Still in beta.
	•	Robotaxis by 2020. Nope.
	•	“$25K Tesla soon.” Still nothing.
	•	Investors have heard it all, and they’re not buying it anymore without real action.

3. Public Sentiment Is TRASH
	•	Musk’s alliance with Trump has alienated core Tesla buyers and ESG-focused investors.
	•	He’s become a culture war figure, not an innovation icon.
	•	His Dogecoin pumping and Twitter chaos have made Tesla feel more like a meme than a market leader.
	•	Google Trends, Twitter mentions, and retail chatter have all cooled significantly—there’s no positive sentiment tailwind this time.

⸻

🧨 GLOBAL MODEL PULLBACKS = BAD SIGNALS

Tesla is literally discontinuing products in multiple markets:
	•	Model S & X canceled in Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Japan due to ending right-hand-drive production.
	•	China pulled U.S.-made Model S/X from its website—no more “Order Now” buttons. Tariffs are biting.
	•	U.S. killed off Model 3 RWD, its cheapest EV, because Chinese-made LFP battery tariffs made it unprofitable.

This is not growth. This is retreat.

🔥 TARIFF WAR = MARGIN SLAUGHTER
	•	10% U.S. tariffs on EVs are in effect, and reciprocals from the EU and China are brewing.
	•	Tesla’s global footprint means they’re hit from all sides.
	•	Elon himself admitted tariffs are “significant.” Translation: margins getting choked.

Just Elon baggage, global retrenchment, and macro headwinds.
