1kz4k4u,Quantum Scamming Inc: The Big Short Nobody Saw Coming,358,191,"Morning fellas, I'm back after more than three years to bring you my highest conviction idea ever. I'm talking 90%+ downside.

**TL;DR:**¬†Quantum computing stocks are the next great meme bubble ‚Äî a flaming clown car of hype, government grants, and zero actual business. Companies like $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI, and especially $QUBT (which literally used to sell flavored beverages) are pretending to be tech plays while burning through cash with nothing to show for it. Even if quantum computing becomes real, Google and IBM already won the arms race. Experts say useful quantum is still 20‚Äì30 years away ‚Äî not 3. This is¬†*The Big Short 2: Quantum Boogaloo*. I‚Äôm shorting these frauds before they drop another 90%. Strap in.

**Introduction:**

Quantum stocks ripped aggressively since the beginning of the year, after the announcement of Willow, Google's new quantum processor. First of all, Google didn't even come up with anything groundbreaking. Ironically, this also highlights how far ahead Google is from the competition. Even worse, some of the stocks below don't even make quantum computers at all.

Quantum computing is 20-30y+ away, if at all. Yet the stocks trade like they cured cancer yesterday. This is honestly a lot worse than Nikola and EV stocks for those who were there back then. They are totally misunderstood by retail, and some of them literaly have 90%+ downside.

**Quantum Computing Basics:**

Quantum computing isn't a better computer. It's a compeltely different paradigm that is only useful to solve very specific and esoteric problems. Like factoring big prime numbers (even that doesn't even work yet) or doing weird matrix math¬†*only under certain condtions.*

To run these algorithms, you don't need just a couple qubits, you need error corrected logical qubits, which take¬†*thousands*¬†of physicals qubits. We're barely

One of the biggest issues with quantum computeers is gate fidelity. This measures how a quantum gate actually performs its intended operation compared to an ideal, noise-free version of that gate. Today, even the best systems get around 99.9% fiedlity under perfect lab conditions. This sounds high, but due to the exponential scaling of quantum algorithms, erors compoound extremely quickly and at 99.9% they are literaly useless. Quantum algos need billions of error free operations and we're nowhere closes. For comparisons, classical computers have gate fidelity of between 10^(-15)¬†and 10^(-18). Thats eighteen 9s after 99, or 99.99999999999999999%. Its not that quantum computers are behind classical computers -¬†*they're basically unusable*

**Industry Experts**

Why should you believe me when I say quantum computing doens't work? After all I'm just a muppet. If you don't take my word for it, listen to the leading industry experts, that spend their days working on it.

Scott Aaronson (Professor, UT Austin, top quanutm complexity theorist):  
""We're nowhere near large-scale quantum computers. The real applications are speculative and still a long way off""

Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA):  
""Quantum computing is decades away. It will not replace classical computing. It's a different tool for very specific problems.""

Dr. Isaac Chuang (MIT, pionner in quantum information):  
""Quantum computers are not yet practical, and may not be for a long time. The barriers are fundamental""

Even if all these people are wrong, Google and IBM are so far ahead, that they'll be the clear winners.

**The Trade:**

The most overvalued and ridiculous names are: $QUBT, $QBTS, $IONQ, $RGTI. I'm short only the first two. They're all ridiculous, but at least IONQ and Rigetti have somewhat of a product.

$QUBT: This is literaly a scam, they've got very little to do with Quantum. These guys were literaly a beverage company. They don't build quantum computers. They sell vague ""quantum inspired"" software with 0 commerical traction. They claim to be ""hardware-agnostic"", which literaly reads ""we don't have a machine"". Imagine being a quantum computing stock with no computer. Revenue in 23 was $100k, not millions, $100k. This is not even a real business, just a vehicule made to earn a quick buck. Their software doens't even require a qaumtum processor to run, it's just classical code with buzzwords. This is my highest conviction short.

$QBTS: These guys make quantum annealers, not even a real quantum computer. They've een in business for 25 years, and only make $9m in revenue, with a market cap of $4.7bn. They were on the brink of bankruptcy, trading for $1, with no cash left. Then the Willow anouncement came and they manage to issue some stock and get some cash back. As a reminder, Willow has nothing to do with QBTS, this will end going back to 0 after the hype subsides.

1kyr6zx,$PBI - Now is the time!,26,21,"Guys, I know my last trade was dumb but this time is different I promise.  This is a publicly traded, technology-driven company that provides shipping, mailing, and financial services. They serve businesses, enterprises, and government entities with solutions for sending, tracking, and managing mail and parcels.

It is currently priced at a discount to competitors.  The reason for that is because the market thinks it's a dying mail company.  The reality is it is cash cow which has been returning value to shareholders and could have three two reasons to moon.  They recently announced a new CEO who runs a hedge fund that looks for ""deep value.""  You may have heard of one of their investments: the brick and mortar game store.  
  
1: USPS Privatization.  
  
Postmaster general DeJoy resigned in March (tension with Trump).  FedEx board member named new Postmaster General USPS cutting 10k jobs, outsourcing to private sector.  If this USPS really has full or partial privatization, PBI would be looking at major increase in business.  


2: PE Buyout

New CEO Kurt Wolf replaced previous CEO because he wanted more aggressive plans and ""strategic initiatives"".  He has been involved in wallstreet for decades and is connected and looking for return on value as his fund is a major investor.  They have been actively reducing debt and cleaning up balance sheet.  Company has fwd P/E of 7 and should continue to rise with improved cost cutting to focus on core business which makes it a solid attractive target for anyone looking for recurring stable profits.  
  
PBI currently trades at major discount to peers (7x fwd P/E).  This is likely due to its large debt and previous poor earnings last year and the previous stink that surrounds it.  However, wallstreet is starting to notice (as evidenced by its stock already being up significantly after each earnings call.  
  
The Math üìä  
  
If USPS privatized:  
  
Revenue: +25-40% (market share capture)  
  
Earnings: +45-80% (pricing power)  
  
At peer multiples: $50-70/share

At current multiples: $20-35/share  
  
Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  
USPS privatization stalls (legal/political), trump still faces resistance in congress.  A recession could kill shipping volumes.  Mail decline accelerates, it is currently losing \~5% revenue yoy.  
  
The Play   
  
Entry: $10-11  
Targets: $20 ‚Üí $35 ‚Üí $50+  
  
This is deep value + proven CEO + industry catalyst. Market pricing for failure while fundamentals improving.

The results were better than expected overall, despite pressure from U.S. government export restrictions. Shares of NVIDIA are up over 6% at today's U.S. stock open.

Overall, NVIDIA Q1 operating income of $44.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of 69%, exceeding analysts' expectations of $43.309 billion, NVIDIA's own guidance of $42.14 billion to $43.86 billion, the previous quarter grew 78% year-on-year. NVIDIA revenue year-on-year growth rate, the lowest single-quarter growth rate in two years, but still stronger than analysts expected growth rate of 66%.

Earnings, Q1 NVIDIA H20 chip export restrictions on NVIDIA had a significant impact. NVIDIA adjusted EPS growth of 33% year-on-year, less than half of the previous quarter's 71% growth rate, $ 0.81 EPS is lower than analysts' expectations of nearly 13%. However, if you exclude the impact of H20 expenses, EPS rebounded to $0.96, also more than 3% higher than analysts' expectations of $0.93.

Gross margins changed similarly, with Q1 adjusted gross margin at 61%, down 17.9 percentage points year-on-year and well below analysts' expectations of 71%. And excluding the impact of H20 gross margin was 71.3%, roughly in line with analyst expectations and NVIDIA's own guidance.

Oscar barely ever shows up. This is rarer than Squidward playing clarinet well. But when he shows up, he PRINTS money. Today, Oscar the Crab emerged from Bikini Bottom and onto OSCR's 3 month chart. 

Here's an analysis of the chart:

1. Oscar's left claw formed. It's a very masculine claw like the ones on Larry the Lobster. 

2. Then comes the shallow retracement to form its belly. It was simply chilling and getting fat after eating too many crabby patties. 

3. Then the BOOM. The right claw spikes up. AND WILL Keep going up after seeing Sandy the squirrel. This isn't just any normal claw. It's a biological response from Oscar the Crab. 

With Oscar's right claw now ready to reach Sandy's Cheeks, he's not here to mess around. He's here to FULLY extend his right claw to $22.

So I did what any logical investor would do after seeing Oscar the Crab on the chart - I bought a modest 7k shares or $100k worth in Oscar. ",1748497293.0

Why it matters:

PwC = Disney‚Äôs auditor. Fubo is switching before the deal closes to avoid SEC auditor independence conflicts. You don‚Äôt do that unless you believe the deal is real and progressing.

No red flags. KPMG didn‚Äôt bounce. There were zero disagreements or ‚Äúreportable events.‚Äù Clean break, clean audit history.
Not opinion shopping. 

Fubo didn‚Äôt go to PwC asking for nicer accounting treatment. This is a straight structural move, not a panic hire.
This is the strongest signal yet that the Disney deal is legit and moving. 

Fubo is laying the groundwork now ‚Äî you don‚Äôt pull this kind of legal/accounting trigger unless something big is coming. üöÄ

Price Target: $20 within 12‚Äì18 months if the deal goes through. That‚Äôs a 3‚Äì4x from here. Market‚Äôs asleep.

Options still dirt cheap. Jan 2026 $10 and $15 calls have low IV. High upside, low cost ‚Äî the kind of asymmetric setup that prints when the market wakes up. üöÄüöÄ

(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

In a new move to hinder China‚Äôs development of advanced semiconductor chips, the Trump administration has reportedly instructed U.S. companies that provide software used in semiconductor design to cease sales to Chinese entities, according to a report by the Financial Times on Wednesday. The directive was issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security, a division of the U.S. commerce department that supervises export controls.

The companies affected by this directive include Electronic Design Automation (EDA) groups such as Cadence, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and¬†Siemens¬†(ETR:SIEGn) EDA. It remains uncertain if all U.S. EDA companies received this instruction.

An official is said to have confirmed that the commerce department is currently evaluating exports of strategic importance to China. During this review, some existing export licenses have been suspended or additional license requirements have been imposed, the official reportedly added.

EDA software, while only comprising a small portion of the overall semiconductor industry, plays a vital role in the supply chain, enabling chip designers and manufacturers to develop and test next-generation chips.

The three companies, Synopsys, Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems, and Siemens EDA, collectively represent approximately 80% of China‚Äôs EDA market.",1748461567.0

1kxb25p,Why is Novo Nordisk (NVO) getting crushed? Down ~50% from last summer‚Äôs high ‚Äî what am I missing?,278,157,"Hey folks,

Trying to wrap my head around Novo Nordisk‚Äôs face-plant. The ADR (NVO) peaked around the $140s last June and now languishes in the mid-60s ‚Äî a **-50% drawdown** even after today‚Äôs little bounce. I‚Äôm not seeing a single ‚ÄúLehman moment,‚Äù so what‚Äôs really driving the exodus?

A few breadcrumbs I‚Äôve picked up, but none of them *feel* big enough alone:

* **CEO ouster:** Board pushed out long-time CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen this month, blaming the share-price slide and loss of GLP-1 momentum. Succession search is on. 
* **Head-to-head data vs. Lilly:** NEJM study showed Lilly‚Äôs Zepbound beating Wegovy for weight-loss efficacy; NVO got clipped another few % that day. 
* **Price-war pressure:** Novo slashed Ozempic/Wegovy list prices after Lilly undercut with $349 direct-sale pricing, sparking worries margins will compress.
* **Growth decel + bearish notes:** Q1 sales still up \~16 % Y/Y but slower than the 30-40 % we saw in 2023; DBS even slapped a *sell* on the name. 

Questions for the hive mind:

1. **Is the market pricing in a long-term erosion of GLP-1 dominance** (manufacturing capacity, oral competitors, price caps)?
2. **Does the CEO switch signal deeper strategic issues** or is it just optics? The Novo Nordisk Foundation still controls the vote.
3. **How bad could margin compression get** if Wegovy/Ozempic turn into a low-price slug-fest?
4. Anyone tracking *pipeline vs. patent cliff* timing here? Is there a sleeper drug that could re-ignite the story like semaglutide did?

Other plays like SOXL should see lots of gains on general overall positive semiconductor sentiment. I'm also in SOXL long. 

My play is ANET for sympathy. Calls are cheap. Thesis on ANET move is based on a general indicator of continued and expanding data center mega-investment and capital spending which ANET benefits. 

Currently sitting at 30% below 52 week high. ANET chart YTD is basically mirror image of NVDA (but so are lots of stocks so doesn't mean much). At current closing price we're only 4.8% off of break even price.

I'm looking for a 25% move to $115 or a 250k net on a 6k cost basis.

The debut is a long-awaited windfall for early investors Atomico, 11.2 Capital, and Insight Partners. It‚Äôs the first major public listing of a VC-backed healthtech company since 2021.

But the valuation is sobering for its later investors, another reminder that public markets are still valuing tech stocks at a discount from 2021 highs. Hinge‚Äôs last two private financings in January and October 2021 valued the company at $3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Coatue and Tiger Global led both rounds. Hinge stockholders, including Tiger Global and Insight, sold about 5.14 million shares in the IPO.

In Hinge‚Äôs public listing, most of the investor-held shares will convert to common stock, but in an unusual move, Tiger elected not to convert some of its preferred shares from the Series E round.

Hinge‚Äôs financial position is strong despite the valuation reset from its 2021 heyday. Its first-quarter revenue grew 50% to $123 million, up from $82 million in the first quarter of 2024. It‚Äôs also narrowed its losses substantially, from $108 million in 2023 to $11.9 million last year.",1748387604.0

LONG BEACH, Calif., May 27, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (""Rocket Lab"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the parent holding company of Geost, LLC (""Geost""), a Tucson, Arizona-based electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) payload development and manufacturing company and provider to high-priority national security satellites, from Lightridge Solutions, a portfolio company of ATL Partners, for $275 million in a mix of $125 million of cash and $150 million in privately placed shares of Rocket Lab common stock, plus up to $50 million in potential additional cash earnout payments tied to revenue targets. The acquisition marks Rocket Lab‚Äôs formal entry into the satellite payload segment, strengthening the Company‚Äôs position as a provider of end-to-end national security space solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

With more than 20 years of flight heritage across classified and unclassified missions, Geost delivers advanced EO/IR sensor systems for missile warning and tracking, tactical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, Earth observation, and space domain awareness‚Äîcore capabilities for achieving the U.S. Department of Defense‚Äôs goals for resilient, proliferated space architectures, like the proposed Golden Dome architecture and the Space Development Agency‚Äôs Tracking Layer.

By bringing these mission critical payloads in-house, Rocket Lab enhances its ability to rapidly deliver integrated spacecraft systems purpose-built for U.S. national security, while reducing integration risk, reducing costs, and accelerating timelines. Geost‚Äôs full suite of sensing solutions enables warfighters and mission operators to protect, defend, and execute with speed and precision in increasingly contested space environments.

The acquisition adds Optical Systems as a new category within Rocket Lab‚Äôs deep portfolio of capabilities, cementing the Company‚Äôs role as a disruptor in national security space.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: ""Rocket Lab was founded to disrupt the traditional space industry and we‚Äôre doing just that by expanding our ability to deliver complete, mission-critical space solutions. With the acquisition of Geost, we‚Äôre bringing advanced electro-optical and infrared payloads in-house to support secure, responsive, and cost-effective systems at scale. These technologies enable spacecraft that can detect, interpret, and respond to threats in real time, enhancing our role as a trusted provider of end-to-end space capabilities for the United States and its allies‚Äîwith greater speed, intelligence, and operational control.""

When baby $RKLB takes a big fat sunbath and goes absolutely ballistic 

There is a pattern forming here : For the past 4 years the stock has been going on a wild run during the summer 

But most importantly, during the nasty downturn caused by tarifs the company has been absolutely destroying on all fronts and my hunch is that it‚Äôs about to get priced into the stock real quick, real strong  

Here‚Äôs a non exhaustive recap of what they have achieved during the bear market : 

- Rocket Lab signed a CARGO MISSION (this is actually insane) with the US military for its Neutron rocket 

- It got onboarded into different pools of contracts but the most important one is NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 worth $5.6 billion in total 

- It will be partnering with Kratos to provide the US military with a 1/week hypersonic capabilities using its HASTE test bed 

- It demonstrated a partially assembled Neutron during its last earning call with a working fairing and is well on time to fly the rocket in EOY 2025  

All of these are potential catalysts that could serve as rocket fuel to lift the stock to new crazy highs. All of this I mentioned is a trail leading to actual new contracts with big $ flowing their way 

$RKLB has positioned itself to be #2 only behind SpaceX and there‚Äôs no one even close to them at this point 

SpaceX valuation : $350B 
Rocket Lab valuation : $11B 

This gap is about to tighten real hard

1kwdpnc,Google's search share falls below 90% - is AI the new king of search?,1278,455,"Looks like the *innovators dilemma* is finally catching up with Google. After a decade of near-absolute dominance, its grip on the global search market is finally showing real cracks.   
Google‚Äôs global search share dropped to 89%, marking the first sustained dip below 90% since 2015.  
This isn‚Äôt just a blip. For past year it has hovered in the under 90% range, signaling a real trend as users shift their habits. What is driving this change?

**Users want answers, not ads pretending to be answers**  

**Users want real solutions to complex problems, not blue links**  

**People are done scrolling through SEO sludge and digging through link farms. Just get straight to the point dammit!**

*Clayton Christensen‚Äôs* theory of disruptive innovation is highly relevant to Google‚Äôs current situation and Google knows it. The theory highlights that disruption thrives when new entrants redefine value propositions. Google‚Äôs creation of Alphabet in 2015 exemplifies a structural solution to this dilemma. By splitting into autonomous subsidiaries (e.g., Waymo, Verily, DeepMind), Google insulated disruptive projects from the financial pressures of its core search business, allowing them to experiment with moonshot ideas without immediate ROI expectations. They tried very hard.....but the gig is up!

A couple of decades ago, when browsers were still relevant, Microsoft won the browser wars but were disrupted by Google which redefined search as the starting value proposition for the internet. Now the AI native competitors - think Perplexity, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok etc - are gaining traction at a very high speed.

The stock price is where it was over a year ago. Even after the recent rally, it is still trading below the 55 & 200 day averages on the daily chart. And there is a bearish RSI divergence on the weeklies. 

AI search is eating Google's lunch. Thoughts?

1kvuqnj,NVIDIA Artificial Intelligence,256,86,"Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) has outperformed every stock in the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)) since¬†[the launch of ChatGPT¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-chatgpt-changed-the-world-of-tech-in-just-one-year-180957543.html)in late November 2022 Shares in the chipmaker have risen nearly 700% since ChatGPT brought the power of artificial intelligence to the masses, far outpacing the S&P 500's roughly 45% over the same time period. The next closest gain for an S&P 500 company in that time period is a 540% pop for Vistra Corp ([VST](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VST)).Nvidia has established itself as the key provider of chips needed to operate AI systems. Now at the epicenter of an AI arms race, Nvidia has established itself as[¬†a cornerstone of the recent bull market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-tech-leads-stocks-higher-as-nvidia-surges-to-record-high-175727614.html)¬†in stocks as the company's sales and profits have skyrocketed over the past several years.

Ahead of the¬†[company's next quarterly earnings release on May 28](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-report-q1-earnings-as-middle-east-deals-export-control-reprieve-boost-stock-122728218.html), we broke down some of the most eye-popping charts that show how Nvidia became one of the most-followed stocks in the market.There's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.3 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC)) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD)) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.Nvidia's rise proved to be at the center of a new technological boom. Combined with Nvidia, the rise in dominance of six other companies ‚Äî Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL),¬†[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)), Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) ‚Äî formed what would come to be known as the¬†[""Magnificent Seven.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html)

The group began the AI boom with a combined market cap just shy of $7 billion. Now, two and a half years later, the Big Tech group's market cap is worth over $16.8 trillion. The seven companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap in November 2022 to 32% of the index's market cap today.Given the outsized weighting in the S&P 500, large swings in shares of Nvidia have become a feature of how even broad market investors are thinking about the direction of stocks. In June 2024,[¬†three Wall Street strategists boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-enthusiasm-prompts-3-wall-street-banks-to-raise-stock-market-forecasts-100027154.html), citing better-than-expected consistent performance among key AI players.

As of May 19, the Magnificent Seven have accounted for about 52% of the S&P 500's gain since Nov. 30, 2022. Nvidia alone has contributed 17.21%, by far the most among the group, with the next closest stock, Microsoft, which has added about 8.8%.Nvidia's stock hasn't been rising from just hype. The company's quarterly financial metrics have soared. In the quarter ChatGPT launched, Nvidia posted revenue of $6.3 billion. Two years later, it would post revenue of $35.3 billion. That's a 460% increase in sales in two years. As seen in the chart below, the main source of growth for Nvidia has been its data center revenue segment, which includes the sales of its AI chips.

From the company's fourth quarter of 2023 to its final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.

Nvidia's data center revenue particularly stands out when considering its rise against peers in the industry. In the final quarter of 2024, Nvidia notched a record $35.58 billion in just data center revenue, up from $3.62 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

In comparison, Alphabet's data center revenue increased to $11.96 billion, ending 2024 up from $7.32 billion in the final quarter of 2022.

1kvubow,Dollar under pressure as tariffs start to stir things up again,470,144,"he U.S. dollar is testing a couple of key support levels as the market is clearly getting restless again over tariff uncertainty. Traders are more or less reminiscent of the U.S.-China trade war. Although it is not 2019, but the ‚Äúfamiliar tension‚Äù is back.



Recent analysis and current tariff policy:

U.S. bond yields fell a little bit, the dollar less interest rate support, coupled with the market for the second half of this year rate cuts are still expected (such as September or November), no one dares to bet on the Fed to raise interest rates again!

President Trump's threat to impose tariffs of 25% to 50% on iPhones made in China has prompted Apple to accelerate plans to move production lines to India and Trump's announcement that he will impose tariffs of 50% on European Union imports starting July 9, after imposing a 10% ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariff on EU goods.



Market Reaction and Economic Impact:

Market Volatility: The Trump administration's tariffs have triggered sharp swings in global markets.

Slowdown in economic growth: High tariffs could dampen economic growth and lead to a decrease in government tax revenues. In addition, companies may reduce the impact of tariffs by avoiding them or adjusting their supply chains, further undermining the effectiveness of the tariff policy

So, all in all It's not that the dollar is going to collapse, but if trade policy continues to be ambiguous and macro data is not strong, then the dollar may continue to dip in the short term



My point of concern:

DXY support around 104 - if it breaks down here, then there could be a real downward move.

The EURUSD is strengthening and commodities (e.g. gold) are slowly moving higher in a classic ‚Äúdollar under pressure‚Äù configuration. Unless Powell has something new to say in his next speech, it will probably be a lower week.



My summary:

The dollar has been a bit of a bear lately.

Tariff uncertainty is making the market nervous.

Markets are generally conservative , watch the DXY and safe-haven asset movements.

While questioning why I keep burning $20 a month on Hulu, $18 on Netflix, $9.99 on YouTube Ad Free and I somehow feel like there must've been a catch with Tubi. Because there's always a catch with these streaming giants. 

Then it occured to me. Tubi TV isn't a giant. But it can be and I believe it will be. 

Nearly 100 million subscribers as of present day. Short of Netflix. But let's face it, the content on there is lacking. 

It's free. But they can grow further by exclusive TV deals and button deals to be on every TV remote. If the service can draw in users then it can grow further by being in everyone's home. 

I'm sure there are others reasons and maybe I'm full of shit. But I am taking a chance. 

I'm gonna start purchasing some Fox class A stocks because that's as close as I can get to owning shares in Tubi.

So here is my dd again with my positions as well. I bought on Friday morning after doing some research on Thursday night at $45.87/share and now its $45.42. Let me know if I need anything else.

VVX (V2X Inc.) is a defense and government services contractor that basically helps the military manage their bases by providing logistics, cyber security, training, and aerospace solutions. It is currently trading around $48 but here is why I think it can at least double its value by the end of the year.

**1. Steady revenue stream from multiple government contracts**

1. $3.7 Billion ‚Äì U.S. Army Warfighter Training Readiness Solutions [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-secures-3-7-billion-task-order-to-spearhead-next-generation-readiness-and-training-capabilities-for-us-army-worldwide-302226964.html)¬†
2. $11.9 Billion JETS 2.0 Contract [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/v2x-awarded-position-on-11-9-billion-jets-2-0-contract-to-deliver-cybersecurity-solutions-302264119.html)¬†

These are just two biggest ones and there are many many more here if you interested [https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./](https://www.prnewswire.com/news/v2x%2C-inc./) This shows that VVX has a lot of revenue laid out in the next few years and still has even more room to grow as they take on more contracts. And because these are government contracts, there is a high renewal chance on these contracts which means recurring revenue streams.

**2. High institutional ownership**¬†

According to Dow Jones Institutional News, institutions own around 16,015,893 shares of VVX. Given that VVX has around 31.68 million shares outstanding, this means institutions own about 50% which suggest a strong foundation in the company.

While I would like to put a link to this, I got this news from my broker so if you use interactive brokers, you can find the news there or maybe your broker has the news too. But here are the shares that some of the institutions hold for reference:

Fidelity Management & Research 3.2 m

BlackRock 1.5m

FIAM LLC 1.5m

Vanguard 896k

**3. Business stability**

This company has been around for over a decade and has been formed via a merger of Vectrus and Vertex in 2022 so this is not just a flashy start up that will die down. They operate in over 50 countries and employs around 16,000 people with the majority of those people being veterans(another plus for a defense company)

**4. Low Volume**

This is a double edged sword as low volume can indicate a bearish sentiment on the stock. However, considering how VVX only has a 7% short interest and high institutional ownership I believe that this is not the case.

In fact, I think its just that there is no sentiment because no one knows about this stock. The average daily volume is 270k which is very very small compared to other companies with such a good foundation. There hasn‚Äôt been any reddit posts or any mention of the stock on the news and the few youtube videos that exist have less than 50 views. This means that its a stock has has been completely missed by retail investors and has a huge potential to grow once people start looking at the stock.¬†

**Now here is the downside as well:**

Their PE ratio is currently around 36, which is high for a defense contractor. However, I believe this is temporary.

VVX recently landed several multi-billion-dollar government contracts. In the early stages of fulfilling these contracts, the company invests heavily in systems, infrastructure, and personnel ‚Äî expenses that reduce short-term profits.

Once the initial setup is complete, these costs drop significantly while revenue continues, which should lead to a much lower PE ratio and stronger earnings.

In fact, their net income has already grown 608% YoY, showing that profitability is trending in the right direction.

**Future Catalysts**

* Next earnings report showing increased income by reducing costs
* More large contract awards (they‚Äôve already landed over $15B+ in just the past year)
* Initiation of analyst coverage or ETF inclusion
* More attention from retail investors

**TL;DR**

* VVX is a defense contractor with with $4.3B revenue and 50% institutional ownership
* It trades at low volume (\~270k/day), has almost zero retail awareness, and has landed over $15B in multiyear government contract over the past year
* Could easily 2x by the end of the year once the market catches on

*Disclaimer: this is my first time doing dd so if I am doing something wrong, let me know how to fix it*

\-it's not priced in  
\-Looking to buy weekly call spreads

Positions:

At the beginning of April, the analyst consensus for NVDA‚Äôs Q1 EPS was an average of $0.93 per share, up from $0.89 in Q4. NVDA‚Äôs EPS has increased QoQ since 2022, when both Q2 and Q3 EPS were $0.03, down from $0.06 in Q1. The image below shows the trend and revisions for analysts‚Äô EPS estimates this quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/2cew4jyvet2f1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=9583d6f1ac0e6d4f870e6da9b8329198681e3e99

The current average estimate is around $0.73 within a week of the release.¬†**That is a decrease of over 20% from the previous consensus, and calls for NVDA‚Äôs first decline in EPS QoQ since 2022.**¬†So what‚Äôs causing this massive shift in expectations?

People will quickly cite the $5.5 billion charge ‚Äúfor inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves‚Äù as the reason for such a drop,¬†**which is completely wrong.**

The charge will almost certainly be listed as a GAAP Non-Operating Expense, meaning that the Non-GAAP expense segments should be minimally impacted. Headlines report the non-GAAP EPS number, meaning the downward revisions have more to do with the indirect impacts of the China export ban and other trade controls, rather than the direct $5.5 billion charge.

A deeper look into the estimates will show that data center revenue and data center margin have seen the most significant negative revisions. The revisions come in response to the H20 ban, which resulted in a loss of 2 weeks of sales in China, and changed the product mix as a % of sales in the quarter.

These are two negative impacts on profitability, with sales and margin on those sales both seeing steep declines. However, it appears analysts may be overestimating how much revenue was lost from those two weeks in China, and may have completely misunderstood how margins will be impacted entirely.

According to Business Daily, China sales represented 13% of NVDA‚Äôs revenue last year, and the share of sales in China has been trending down. Since 2 weeks of a 13 week quarter is about 15% of the total time, and about 13% of revenue from that two weeks is gone, basic math tells us Data Center Revenue should decrease by roughly 2%.

My initial estimate was $41.0 billion, and decreasing it by 2% would amount to about $40.2 billion. Analyst consensus is sitting around $38.5 billion according to Nasdaq(dot)com, an increase of only 8.1% QoQ. Below is a graph of Data Center Revenue for the past 11 quarters, shown in blue, with the red point being analyst estimates for the current quarter.

[The Consensus is a massive slowdown this quarter](https://preview.redd.it/2rosyfazet2f1.png?width=1967&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4715f993863c35850b5e96c315e0c5a05e12a7d)

As for the impact on gross margin, analysts have revised their estimates down due to the shift in product mix without the H20 chips and other China products.

According to Yahoo Finance, H20 chips were estimated in the 50% range for margins, and their recent strength actually put downward pressure on margins. This means it is unlikely that the new product mix has a significantly lower margin than pre-H20 ban.

The company-issued guidance for gross margin in the current quarter is 71%, with the average analyst now expecting 68.4% according to CMC Markets.

Since the total revenue average estimate is $43.1 billion, and $38.5 billion is data center revenue, we know the other three segments are estimated to contribute $4.6 billion to total revenue.

I estimate $4.2 billion from the remaining segments, but a higher gross margin using 71% from company-issued guidance.

So, how much distance is between my estimates and the analysts‚Äô estimates? Well, analysts are currently expecting $43.1 billion in revenue and 68.4% gross margin, while I anticipate at least $44.3 billion and 71% margins. The product of those numbers is the profit before subtracting Operating and Non-Operating Expenses, and dividing by shares outstanding.

**I have $31.453 billion, while the analyst consensus is $29.48 billion, which is almost $2 billion lower.**

Even if expenses come in higher than the company-issued guidance, analysts have sandbagged expectations going into the print. I expect a massive ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù beat on earnings day.

**Most importantly, a large beat still may not be priced in, even after the pre-earnings rally. The stock is still around the same price it was going into last quarter‚Äôs print. If we see QoQ earnings growth beating estimates, I believe investors will take the stock higher, while if this is all a pipe dream and earnings do decline, we could stay rangebound or worse.**¬†

1kuox31,Mapping Trump Announcement impacts on stock market since January 2025. Most of them happen in the Wednesday and Thursday Morning,4127,194,"
First, the significant moves and impact on SPY within the 50ish decision pool highlighted below :

* In the week end leading to Monday morning, February 3, 2025, Trump unveiled steep tariffs on North American and Chinese goods, leading to a 2.0 % ish ( at some point) in SPY as markets reacted to geopolitical tensions.
* On Monday morning, March 3, 2025, Trump imposed new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, prompting a 1.8 % ish ( at some point) drop in SPY amid renewed trade war fears.
* On Wednesday afternoon, April 2, 2025, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, leading to a 6 % ish (at some point) plunge in SPY the next day in a sharp market crash.
* On Wednesday morning, April 9, 2025, Trump declared a 90 day pause on most tariffs except China, sparking a +9 % ish ( at some point) rally in SPY, the best single day gain since the 1940s.
* One day after,on Thursday morning, April 10, 2025, Trump clarified that tariffs on Chinese imports would be even higher than expected, reversing prior gains and dragging SPY down 4 % ish ( at some point).

Digging deeper, below is an analysis of Trump Announcements impacts ( only the 50 ish most relevant , summary table below) on the Stock Market since January 2025 up to mid May 2025, or an average of 2.5 meaningful announcement per week since January 20, 2025; or \~17 weeks ). Index prices (NYSE composite and SPY) and sectorial ETFs were mainly analyzed. For SPY, data output and overall reaction is a bit skewed toward magnificent seven and IT sector reaction given their weight and market cap.

Some Redditors asked about how impact is assessed. This involved lot of data scraping and adjustments to isolate the effect of the news. Typically, after an announcement, I tend to analyze the index direction 24 hours prior to identify the pre-existing trend, which could come from a general event or another Trump announcement. Then, I examine the index performance 24 hours post announcement (mostly from the last close to the closing price at the day of the announcement or to a specific trading hour). So, if Trump reverses a policy within three trading sessions for instance, the broader NYSE composite index's variance may initially seem minor (1 to 3 %) over plus or minus few trading sessions, as to cancel previous decision impact and due to its overall composition, a basket of sectors (defensive, cyclical, etc..). However, when zooming on sectors or stocks highly sensitive to specific announcements, the material impact can be isolated. And after the analysis, once I find a trend, I use the help of Grok, Chat GPT, Claude (latest updates are very strong in analyzing complex data) and Gemini to analyze the raw data and see if they intersect with my pattern analysis.

At first, I thought Fridays were the worst, because a surprise announcement over the weekend could hurt my investments when markets reopen Monday but the analysis didn‚Äôt fully confirm that. What is certain though is that a Friday announcement late in the day, or early Monday morning can seriously mess up a trading plan if you have a significant dollar exposure.

Let‚Äôs see if his next announcements fit the pattern in the upcoming weeks and beyond until he decides to retire from presidency..I will be updating this monthly and include also impact on options prices

Positive impacts:

* Defense, private prison, and energy sectors often saw gains after border, military, and energy policy announcements.
* Tech stocks benefited from deregulation, AI investments, and new councils focusing on science/technology.
* Tariff announcements had mixed but generally sector-specific positive impacts on U.S. producers.
* Cryptocurrency and memecoin promotions caused spikes in crypto-related stocks.

Negative impacts:

* Broad market dips often followed announcements around tariffs on imports and federal aid halts.
* Healthcare and education sectors were negatively affected by funding cuts and bans.
* Renewable energy and EV-related stocks dropped when Trump reversed Biden-era environmental policies.
* Consumer goods stocks occasionally dipped due to tariff threats and trade tensions.

Neutral/Minimal impact:

* Social and political announcements like pardons and symbolic declarations usually had minimal stock market impact.
* Some federal policy reversals had muted or negligible effects on broader markets.

¬†**Typical Market Reaction Patterns**

* Morning announcements (9:00‚Äì11:00 AM EST):
   * Often involved regulatory changes, new councils, or executive orders.
   * Markets reacted positively to innovation-related announcements (AI, crypto) and negatively to funding cuts.
* Afternoon announcements (12:00‚Äì7:00 PM EST):
   * Frequently focused on enforcement actions, tariffs, and emergency declarations.
   * Mixed market reactions: defense and energy up, consumer and manufacturing stocks down.
* Day of week trends:
   * Monday: Multiple impactful policy announcements; mixed market reactions with slight dips due to policy uncertainty.
   * Tuesday & Wednesday: High frequency of tariffs, funding cuts, and enforcement announcements; often negative or sector-specific impacts.
   * Thursday: Mostly enforcement, immigration, and defense-related announcements; moderate positive impact on defense.
   * Friday: Mixed, including sanctions, crypto promotions, and layoffs; markets generally down or flat.
   * Saturday & Sunday: Few announcements, mostly symbolic or enforcement-related with limited market impact.

Most mid week news (Wednesday and thursday) seem to be the catalysts for SPY trend pattern confirmation or reversal.

Honestly i haven‚Äôt seen a lot of quality discussion about the planned robotaxi launch in June. Otherthan bulls and bears yelling on each other and random meme shit. 
Let‚Äôs collect all the facts and try to find what‚Äôs gonna happen in few weeks. 

Here are some facts we know so far and i will try to be impartial as i can be and just state facts and not my opinion. 
- Elon announced robotaxi planned launch in Austin in June. 
- TSLA stock has rallied 40+ % since the announcement. 
- TSLA sales are being disastrous worldwide and on going sales news are negative. Hence making the stock rally purely based on hopium on robotaxi launch. 
- TSLA FSD is currently at level-2 autonomy. 
- Full autonomy with driver less operation is level-5. 
- Tsla uses a complete vision based system. vs competitors multiple sensors including LIDAR and Radars. 
- We haven‚Äôt seen any test vehicles or any tests happening around robotaxi despite launch date being just few weeks away. (Waymo did years of testing before making their service publicly available)
- On the otherside, tsla fans seems to be seeing all the current fsd being driven by consumers are actual test and that is good enough for fsd launch. 

That‚Äôs all for now. Let‚Äôs discuss and as we go we can add more points and if possible we can keep this as a long thread to keep track the planned event.

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) \-- Shares of Informatica (NYSE: INFA) surged over 20% today after reports emerged that Salesforce (NYSE: NYSE:CRM) is in renewed talks to acquire the cloud data management firm. The news, first reported by Bloomberg, has reignited interest in a deal that was previously considered but did not materialize last year. Meanwhile, Salesforce stock fell 3% amidst the speculation.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the acquisition discussions are ongoing, and an agreement could be announced as early as next week. However, they also cautioned that no final decision has been made, and the talks could still fall through. It was also noted that another potential buyer, Cloud Software Group, has expressed interest in Informatica.

The movement in both stocks reflects investor reactions to the potential acquisition. For Informatica, the surge in stock price indicates a positive market response to the possibility of being acquired by a larger player like Salesforce. On the other hand, Salesforce‚Äôs dip may be attributed to concerns over the cost and integration challenges of such a deal.

As the talks are private, the details remain speculative, and the companies have not issued any official statements regarding the potential acquisition.¬†",1748029199.0

Pfizer maintains a solid revenue base, reporting $62.46 billion in total revenue in the last fiscal year. Despite recent fluctuations, its profitability remains intact, with a gross profit of $45.15 billion. The company continues to invest in drug innovation and strategic acquisitions, ensuring long-term growth.  
  
Pfizer is a consistent dividend payer, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. Its dividend yield remains competitive, reinforcing its appeal as a long-term hold.

AES has a solid business model, strong cash flow, and strategic growth in the energy sector.  
Harmonic patterns indicate an ideal buying opportunity, further confirmed by negative divergence on the RSI indicator.

On Wednesday, SPY dropped 1.5% off of a bad news for once, so I have already changed my view on the market sentiment, and decided to go half bear. I bought UVIX after the drop at $32, and after some Trump tweets, it is now sitting at roughly $35 per share, a quick 10% gain. I can see SPY dropping down to 560 near term, so I bought in a little bit more. I plan to sell some shares when SPY does hit 560, and I'll see how the market continues to act and what else Trump ends up saying at that point.

What Happened?

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 36.3% in the afternoon session after renewed enthusiasm for quantum computing following the sharp pullback in the first quarter of the year.

While specific news for the day wasn't immediately apparent to have caused a major surge, the company has had a series of positive announcements, including strong Q1 2025 earnings that beat analyst estimates.

Earlier in the week, the company announced a collaboration with Swedish company Einride to develop quantum solutions for fleet routing, logistics optimization, and supply chain solutions. This would also extend to Einride's autonomous and electric fleet operations worldwide, two of the fast evolving tech markets, which hold a lot of opportunities and growth potential.

Adding to the optimism, the company's CEO reiterated its ambitious mission to become the 'Nvidia of quantum computing' in an interview with Barron's.

The shares closed the day at $45.88, up 36.9% from previous close.

The previous big move we wrote about was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 7.9% on the news that investor sentiment improved on renewed optimism that the US-China trade conflict might be nearing a resolution. According to reports, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reinforced this positive outlook by describing the trade war as ""unsustainable,"" and emphasized that a potential agreement between the two economic powers ""was possible."" His comments signaled to markets that both sides might be motivated to seek common ground, raising expectations for reduced tariffs and more stability across markets.

IonQ is up 4.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $45.01 per share, it is still trading 11.9% below its 52-week high of $51.07 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ‚Äôs shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,168.

Today‚Äôs young investors likely haven‚Äôt read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on¬†a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",1747946816.0

üìä Chart Overview (5-Day Trend)

	‚Ä¢	Current Price: $2.81 CAD (up +1.08%)
	‚Ä¢	Recent High: $2.95
	‚Ä¢	Recent Low: ~$2.34
	‚Ä¢	Trend: The price shows a strong bullish trend from May 15‚Äì21, rallying from approximately $2.40 to near $2.95 before a slight retracement.
	‚Ä¢	Volume: Low and sporadic, suggesting minimal retail-driven volatility; institutional or algorithmic moves might be more likely in play.

üîç Technical Analysis

1. Support & Resistance

	‚Ä¢	Support Levels:
	‚Ä¢	$2.60 (minor)
	‚Ä¢	$2.40 (strong support zone from early May)
	‚Ä¢	Resistance:
	‚Ä¢	$2.90 (short-term cap; price rejected at this level multiple times)
	‚Ä¢	$3.00 (psychological barrier)

2. Momentum

	‚Ä¢	Upward price momentum suggests accumulation phase.
	‚Ä¢	The retracement around May 21‚Äì22 seems to be a healthy consolidation, not a breakdown.

3. Patterns

	‚Ä¢	The chart shows a cup-with-handle-like formation, which is often a bullish continuation pattern.
	‚Ä¢	If the $2.90 resistance is broken with volume, a breakout toward $3.20‚Äì$3.30 could occur.

üìà Short-Term Prediction (Next 1‚Äì3 Weeks)

Assuming broader market stability and continued bullish momentum in the crypto sector:

	‚Ä¢	Bullish Scenario: Break above $2.90 with volume could push the stock to $3.20‚Äì$3.30.
	‚Ä¢	Neutral Scenario: Sideways movement between $2.70 and $2.90.
	‚Ä¢	Bearish Risk: Drop below $2.60 support could lead to a retest of $2.40.

üåê Macro & Company Outlook (2025)

Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. has pivoted from purely blockchain/crypto mining into AI and high-performance computing infrastructure, which positions it well in two high-growth sectors:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin & Ethereum Mining: If crypto markets continue to rally (especially post-Bitcoin halving), revenue could increase significantly.
	‚Ä¢	AI Data Center Expansion: Hive has been repurposing mining infrastructure for AI compute, a strong growth angle in 2025.

üîÆ 2025 Forecast

If:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin stays above $80k usd
	‚Ä¢	Hive expands GPU infrastructure for AI compute
	‚Ä¢	Power costs remain manageable

Then HIVE.V could see upside toward $5.00-8.00 CAD over the next 6‚Äì12 months.

However, risk factors include:

	‚Ä¢	Bitcoin/Ethereum price volatility
	‚Ä¢	High electricity costs
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory shifts in crypto/AI sectors

‚úÖ Summary

	‚Ä¢	Short-Term Outlook: Mildly bullish, possible breakout above $2.90.
	‚Ä¢	Mid-Term (3‚Äì6 mo): Bullish if crypto markets remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Long-Term (2025): High upside if Hive executes AI/compute pivot well, but volatility remains a risk.

Market rallied , but I‚Äôve still got time and I‚Äôm still confident in the setup.

That said, with SPY rising since, I figured it was time to double down and make another move. This time I‚Äôm going further out ‚Äî grabbed **100 SPY 555 puts expiring 8/29** at **$11.87 avg**.

Why? Because I think this market cracks before the end of summer.

Too much uncertainty, too much froth, and too many people pretending we‚Äôre in some kind of post-soft-landing utopia. Unless the orange man jumps in and pulls off another save-the-market campaign, I‚Äôm betting we head lower.

**Valuations are insane**

P/E ratios are sky-high across the board. Market is pricing in non-stop growth while ignoring margin compression, flat guidance, and global slowdowns.

**Tariff pause expiration on the horizon**

First 90-day trade pause ends soon. The **China one ends late August**, right on my contracts. If tensions rise again, this market doesn‚Äôt have the stomach for it.

**Rising yields = risk-off**

Treasury yields are creeping back up, and the deficit is ballooning. If this keeps going, multiples get crushed. Risk assets will feel it.

**Consumer‚Äôs tapped out**

Credit card debt at ATHs, delinquencies up, and inflation‚Äôs still lingering. Average American is out of ammo ‚Äî and it‚Äôs showing.

**Macro/political clown show**

China relations, inflation risk, global instability ‚Äî all of it is underpriced.

**TL;DR:**  
100 SPY 555P for 8/29. Valuations are cooked, tariffs about to spark, yields climbing, consumer‚Äôs broke, and the market‚Äôs drunk on hopium. Betting big on a summer fade. Let‚Äôs see if we print.

1kst0a8,GLD Puts and here‚Äôs why,3,52,"Position GLD put @ 305 July

Gold has had a remarkable run during all this crazyness. Up 25% YTD and 38% in the last year. While long term I would t bet against gold but this increase is insane. Gold has been touted as a inflationary hedge as well as a stabilizing investment when fear is high. The primary consensus on the bull run for gold is the uncertainty of stocks and then uncertainty of bonds. Long term yields have continued to climb for US treasuries and this is why I believe Gold is going to come back down.
Institutional investors want certainty where they can get it. US treasuries is a relatively risk free investment that is now paying a premium. My belief is we are going to see a massive shift from the GLD into longer term US treasuries as yield start to peak. This is not what is the better investment it is about risk management. Portfolio managers have been buying short term treasuries because long term treasuries have been dog shit for yields because everyone expected rates to go down by now. The yield inversion caused massive amounts of money to stay in short term treasuries because it created by comparison risk exposure to long term treasuries. We are seeing that risk play out right now. Long term yields are rising because the downgrade and also short term rates have stayed elevated past their expected time frame. 
Like everything this comes down to timing. I picked July because my hope is the trade crap is at least calmed. We find our inflation ain't so bad. Unemployment has gone up enough for the fed to start signaling rate cuts.

1ksme7s,Unpopular opinion on DWAVE(QBTS),63,94,"So here is the deal guys, I have been doing some research into D-Wave and here is what I would like to share with the entire community.

Let me start with the very basic and something everyone knows already( I hope) they are in the quantum industry, currently there are 6000+ devoting they time in some sort of quantum research, of those 6000, ‚Äúonly‚Äù  513 are pure-play ,  D-Wave is part of the later, so 1/513.

‚Ä¶.Yes its a crowded space.

First lets talk about the fundamentals (in the end its all about that anyway)

Last year they made 8M of revenue and spend 75M, so they lost almost 70M in 2024. Simple maths so far right. In terms of Price/earnings (the famous P/E)  is non, zero, nada, and thats ok for a new company, specially in the early stages. Right?

Wrong they exist since 1999, yes you hear that right, 25+ years and since they started operations they were never profitable. 25 years old company. ‚Ä¶Let that sink in.

Now some red flags are becoming clear, but hey lets calm down, 1 ratio is not enough to give the big picture, one must have a ‚Äúhelicopter view‚Äù.

2024 Price to Book (P/B)=35.22 For comparison the average price for a Nasdaq100 company is 4.56.  And yes the most valued companies in the world (Apple/Googles‚Ä¶etc) are almost 8 times cheaper than D-Wave. And they (Apple,microsoft‚Ä¶et al)are not the cheapest stock to own by any means.

Ok so P/E and P/B are screaming red flags, lets have a look at EV/Revenue as a better metric since it takes into consideration debt and cash on hand, and not only Market Cap.

2024 EV/Revenue is a whopping‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶241 2024  D-Wave EV/Revenue=241, you guys have any idea of how hard this? Again, for comparison the average Nasdaq 100 company sits at just 6.84 Crazy right?‚Ä¶

But wait there more‚Ä¶ 2024 Price to sales (P/S)=154  this basically means that for $1 they get in revenue they need to spend $154+ For comparison, the average Nasdaq100 company sits at 2.85.

Let me get this straight:  D-Wave is 75 x expensive that the most valuable companies in the world (and again, those companies are not cheap to own)

Am sorry to be repetitive, but I have to say it again: D-Wave is 75x more EXPENSIVE than the MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES in the WORLD.

U guys know how much dilution occur last year? 260M, 266,595,867 if u wanna be precise.

They are laughing at us retailers while cashing millions and providing for their families, and you guys allow that to happen by buying a laughing stock.

It‚Äôs a JOKE!!!!

Yes, revenue increased 500% in last Q, they sold a single computer for 13M and they did not disclose how long it take them to build(wondering why?). Allow me to explain why, on average it takes 3-5 years, lets be optimistic here and assume the best scenario, lets say they made it in 2 years, world record (and remember if they did that, they would be bragging on the media).

The second important question would be, how much it cost them? Well they did not disclose as always. Well, if u take again the best case scenario, and imagine that they build in the last 2 years, it cost 79.3M(2023) + 75.6M (2024) thats the amount they lost in the last 2 years, but this includes everything (COGS: Cost of Good sold, General and Administrative Expenses, R&D,Selling & Marketing)

By the way, you know what they spend those 155M of expenses ending 2024 and 2023? Its all salaries, 85% to be more precise.

35% its all for administration and high management salaries, 25% for the research and development team salaries 15% was just for PPE and the last 10% was on marketing.

In other words they spend more on high management than in R&D. You know how CRAZYY this is?

And one more thing‚Ä¶
Last night the CEO is dumping 14,3M shares of the stock after pumping the stock price a day to an all time high with the release 
of a new QC Advantage2, let me repeat this so that it really sinks in.
The CEO of DWave is dumping almost x2 the amount the company made in Revenue as I post this

This was allowed to go public via a SPAC, the biggest scam in modern history of investing. Am not going to go into details but please kindly do ur own research.

Paywall: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/us-to-keep-china-chip-curbs-spurning-nvidia-s-call-for-relief)

(Bloomberg) ‚Äî The Trump administration will maintain efforts to keep advanced artificial intelligence technology out of China‚Äôs hands, a top White House official said, brushing off calls from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang to ease restrictions on chip exports to the world‚Äôs second largest economy.

‚ÄúWe obviously have huge respect for Jensen,‚Äù Sriram Krishnan, White House senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence, said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to inside China, I do think there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they‚Äôre physically inside‚Äù the country, he added.

While the Trump administration still sees a security risk from widening AI chip exports to China, Krishnan said it agrees with Huang‚Äôs view that restrictions on a wide range of other US trading partners need to be revisited. The Trump administration is rescinding and moving to replace the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that Krishnan said created ‚ÄúGPU haves and GPU have nots.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it comes to the rest of the world, we want American AI stack starting from the GPUs to the models to everything on top,‚Äù Krishnan said. ‚ÄúOn that, Jensen and I and us are in agreement.‚Äù

Krishnan spoke hours after Huang made his most forceful public comments to date against escalating US export restrictions aimed at China. Speaking at the Computex industry conference in Taipei, Huang blasted the measures as a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù and urged the US to lower barriers to chip sales in China before American firms cede the market to rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co.

Huang told reporters that China will account for a $50 billion opportunity in 2026. ‚ÄúChina has 50% of the world‚Äôs AI developers, and it‚Äôs important that when they develop on an architecture, they develop on Nvidia, or at least American technology,‚Äù he said. Nvidia recently wrote off $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips that had been designed to comply with previous export curbs, but were targeted by a new round of restrictions from the Trump administration this year.

Krishnan pointed to the flurry of projects in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced by American companies during President Donald Trump‚Äôs trip to the Middle East last week as evidence of a new effort to ease US allies‚Äô access to AI. He stressed that the agreements would still contain security restrictions to prevent the illegal transfer of advanced technology to China and other adversaries.

‚ÄúThese deals and these GPUs are predominantly going to be run by American hyperscalers, American cloud service providers and American companies,‚Äù said Krishnan, who was a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz prior to joining the White House. ‚ÄúMost of these GPUs are going to be run, hosted, controlled by American companies.‚Äù",1747855124.0

1ks3c7t,Canada Goose stock up nearly 30%; no guidance from parka maker as Trump's tariffs create 'uncertain times',53,22,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-goose-stock-up-nearly-30-no-guidance-from-parka-maker-as-trumps-tariffs-create-uncertain-times-163122634.html)

Shares of Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS.TO)(GOOS) soared by nearly 30 per cent on Wednesday as the luxury parka maker booked strong quarterly sales and rising net income. CEO Dani Reiss says while business is brisk today, a U.S.-led global trade war could shrink demand.

Toronto-based Canada Goose declined to issue financial guidance for its current fiscal year as it reported results on Wednesday, citing ‚Äúmacroeconomic uncertainty and dynamic consumer spending patterns brought on by the unpredictable global trade environment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe decision not to provide an outlook for the year is entirely around what we see as a fairly uncertain consumer environment around the world,‚Äù Reiss told analysts on a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThese are uncertain times.‚Äù

Reiss says the current tariff landscape is ‚Äúnot material‚Äù to the company‚Äôs 2026 plans directly.

‚ÄúApproximately 75 per cent of our units are made in Canada, virtually all complying with USMCA (United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement), which means they are currently exempt from tariffs,‚Äù chief operating officer Beth Clymer added on the call.

‚ÄúOur remaining production, which is primarily from Europe, is facing increasing tariffs. But they will have minimal financial impact.‚Äù

Toronto-listed Canada Goose shares rose as much as 28.3 per cent on Wednesday. The stock was up 26.41 per cent at $15.70 per share as at 10:58 a.m. ET.

For the three months ended March 30, Canada Goose reported $27.1 million in net income attributable to shareholders, up from $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Sales increased 7.4 per cent year-over-year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 48.9 per cent on an annual basis.

Despite the strong results, Canada Goose now joins the list of Canadian firms lowering or eliminating financial guidance as U.S. President Donald Trump attempts to overhaul America's trade links with the rest of the world. So far this earnings season, Air Canada (AC.TO), Rogers Communications (RCI-B.TO), A&W Food Services of Canada (AW.TO) have been among companies issuing weaker guidance for 2025.

BMO chief investment strategist¬†Brian Belski recently advised investors to look past these revisions.

1. NVDA is holding 1.7 million share at 16.4$ average cost.
2. Uber is investing 100 million into the company, and they just recently delivered the first driverless robotaxi rides in the Middle East. WeRide also collaborating extensively with UAE government.
3. Manufacturing costs substantially lower than Waymo - this is perhaps the key advantage of robotaxi stocks who collaborates with Chinese auto firms. Waymo is currently seeking partnerships with Zeekr, which means that WeRide is one step ahead.
4. Pony AI was originally 3x their market cap, despite arguably worst products - especially in terms of overall safety record. WeRide has had 0 incidents to date.
5. WeRide possess regulatory permits for 5 countries: France, China, UAE, Singapore, and the US. Global expansion far faster than peers. More are on the way - e.g. Switzerland.
6. Strategic collaboration with Tencent, with future incorporation into Tencent's super app WeChat. This will help broaden WeRide's reach, while also providing WeRide with ample cloud resources.
7. Listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange is likely coming this year. Given how well IPOs have done (e.g. CATL) on there this year and WeRide's cheap valuation, one can expect a significant boost to the stock.
8. CEO and CTO are both highly competent, who helped pioneer the industry in China at Baidu.

Overall, I think this is perhaps one of the best ways to play the robotaxi theme. My plan is to hold my shares for the next few years as the fleet grows. Will look to add more on pullbacks.",1747842478.0

Warby Parker¬†shares surged 15.6% after Google announced a smart glasses partnership at the tech company‚Äôs annual I/O developer conference.

Google¬†has committed up to $150 million as part of the agreement. The company has put $75 million into product development costs and will invest as much as an additional $75 million into the glasses company if Warby meets ‚Äúcertain collaboration milestones,‚Äù the companies¬†announced.

Warby Parker said it plans to launch a series of smart glasses with Google, with the first line of products set to arrive sometime ‚Äúafter 2025.‚Äù The glasses will be¬†built on top of Google‚Äôs Android XR, an operating system for headset computers. Android XR will include Google‚Äôs Gemini AI assistant that users can speak with to control their device.

‚ÄúWe know that these need to be stylish glasses that you‚Äôll want to wear all day,‚Äù said Shahram Izadi, Google‚Äôs vice president and general manager of Android XR, at the I/O keynote. ‚ÄúWe want you to be able to wear glasses that match your personal taste.‚Äù

The Warby Parker and Google alliance will rival that of the partnership between Facebook-parent¬†Meta¬†and EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban. Meta and Luxottica in 2023¬†launched the second edition¬†of their smart glasses, and the two companies are set to roll out a third generation of the glasses with a small display, CNBC previously reported. Meta first¬†announced the partnership¬†in 2020.

The partnership with Warby Parker is also a return to the world of glasses for Alphabet. The company famously launched its futuristic Google Glass device in 2013, but the product drew privacy concerns.

Besides Warby Parker, Google on Tuesday said it will partner with developers and device makers for Android XR, including Samsung,¬†Qualcomm, Sony,¬†Xreal, Magic Leap, Gentle Monster and others.",1747777209.0

1kr6z47,LQDA Bullish Play,8,9,"Reposting with a screenshot of my open positions, as the previous post got removed. I've opened calls with June 20th expiration at $22.5 & $25 strike

If you're looking for a high reward play, this might just be for you. Liquidia (LQDA), a biopharma company, is currently seeking FDA approval for its flagship drug YUTREPIA, which treats pulmonary hypertension. Liquidia was granted tentative FDA approval in 2024 based on satisfactory regulatory standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Final approval was only withheld due to United Therapeutics' (UTHR) exclusivity patent for Tyvaso, a 2009 drug that was approved to treat the same conditions. UNTHR's exclusivity status is set to expire on May 23rd, 2025, and the FDA has a set an official approval target date of May 24th, 2025, for LQDA's YUTREPIA.¬† Although UTHR has filed multiple lawsuits against LQDA to stop it from commercializing YUTREPIA, UTHR has lost every time. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)'s decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit & the United States Supreme Court and there is reportedly no possibility of further appeal. The latest lawsuit that UTHR filed in early May 2025 file is even narrower in scope than their previous lawsuit and it legally would not get in the way of FDA approval.

Analysts are currently bullish on LQDA, with Raymond James citing a price target of $29. Almost every analyst that has expressed assessments for Liquidia has given bullish ratings. In fact, 4 out of 7 have increased their price targets, the other 3 holding them constant. One exception, Oppenheimer, has recently downgraded the stock ‚Äì more so as a long-term forecast, as they still expect the company to obtain FDA approval in the short term. This is also an outlier compared to every other analyst call.

Once FDA approval is granted, LQDA can begin commercializing its YUTREPIA offering, which so far is the only competing drug against UTHR's Tyvaso. For context, Tyvaso generated $1.6B in sales for UTHR, or 56% of their revenue. I have been monitoring the situation with Liquidia since they received tentative approval from the FDA last year and given all the positive developments, I believe that now it's the time to buy. Options have gotten cheaper in the last few days, as people panic sold the Oppenheimer downgrade. Get in now while still cheap!",1747753090.0

1kqhzj0,408K YOLO INTO $IOVA,299,240,"Today, I present to you, fellow regards, Iovance Biotherapeutics ($IOVA). Am a long-time lurker of many subs, and this is my first time posting a DD so be nice please:

**TLDR:** IOVA is an exciting biotech company that develops tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies to treat cancer, and it has the potential to be a multi-bagger in the next year or so. There is very limited downside risks after dropping 45% following Q1 earnings, and 96.2% from ATH given the quality of their assets + 0 debt.

**Reasons:**

1. The stock is priced like it is about to collapse: The company has a 574 million market cap, 360 million cash, 0 debt, 1 manufacturing facility, and the only FDA approved TIL therapy (helps treat patients with very advanced melanoma). The company trades at a <1 price to book, which is ridiculously cheap.
2. There is rapid growth projected in 2025 and 2026 due to EU expansion, acceleration of Amtagvi roll-out, various pipelines... coming soon. Q1 problems (maintenance and slower ATC provision) are temporary and management has said infusions have normalized in Q2 already.
3. European expansion - this is expected to be this year. A look at Iovance's Linkedin shows that they are already heavily recruiting in Europe, which is a sign that approval is going well. They are also heavily recruiting in general, which is always a bullish sign.

https://preview.redd.it/g8i5be5zzr1f1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba7a251707bc9317b7107570ed0a88424fc2445

4. The core therapy is very advanced - one of the few that aim to provide individualized, durable care to solid tumors, and is used by treatment centers ranging from Stanford Healthcare, NYU/Columbia Irving Medical Center, UCLA Hospital... It seems to be highly regarded in the medical community and it seems cool as fuck - potential applications are endless.

https://preview.redd.it/9wqudzvdzr1f1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c12eb494ff7d79ed70f0aae1f5193b58aa8d0b

5. They currently charge 500k+ USD per patient, but this is covered by insurance for the majority of Americans (250 million+ covered for this). It provides a 32% objective response rate (tumor shrinking, with 4% having their tumor disappear completely) for patients with melanoma who have already tried other treatments.

https://preview.redd.it/3v6rtngr0s1f1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a86d37c44b78c68d6b8e1681e361b1772edb3dd0

6. If drug roll-out is successful, management expects \~1.5 billion in annual revenue at 70% gross margins - so will almost certainly multi-bag. This is around 30,000 patients per year globally.

7. They have a very robust pipeline of clinical trials. If they can prove that the drug works for NSCLC or that it is helpful for frontline melanoma, then the total addressable market expansion will be massive. This is on top of the 30,000 market size that they have already projected for the FDA approved treatment.

https://preview.redd.it/ojqlpv3bzr1f1.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfdcf28638d4b33c3e889c16d7575b7ebedb929f

8. If drug roll-out is unsuccessful, downside is limited by assets + buyout potential. As discussed before, price to book is below 1. There is 0 debt, and cash makes up \~60% of market cap. TIL therapy is highly interesting as a potential cure for all types of cancers, and there are likely many large pharmaceutical companies that may be interested in acquiring the patents/tech.

9. CEO Dr. Fred Vogt bought 25k shares last week on the open market for the first time. Management is not that great at communicating, but company fundamentals are strong and this is a sign of faith.

https://preview.redd.it/faixn1a8zr1f1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b04b84e99359cf2fd5b462c70a17ee1ca6e5a90

10. Management dropping guidance after realizing it takes a bit longer for treatment centers to bring in patients sucks only if you bought before they dropped it (and the stock tanks 45%). Now, with a far more conservative guidance, management has far more room to outperform. In Q2, guidance should be easily met given what management said in the earnings call.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

1. ASCO 2025 conference, where will discuss results of a few clinical trials + host round table with experts.
2. Q2 Earnings where treatment results should normalize.
3. European expansion should be announced in the next few months.

**Positions:** 238 thousand shares at $1.73 average price.

**Conclusion:**

$IOVA is very cheaply priced, is a leader in one of the most exciting technologies in healthcare, and has an FDA approved life-saving drug. **Price target: 10$.**

Let me know your thoughts. I think stock was quite risky a few weeks ago (and more so a few years ago) - now I believe risk-reward one of the most attractive out there. This is not financial advice. Pray for me.

**Edit 1:** There are a number of class action lawsuits because the stock dropped 45% after Q1 earnings due to management lowering guidance + manufacturing maintenance impacting revenue. If you look at the earnings calls for the past few quarters, there was indeed poor communication + too much optimism, but it is hard to argue that this is fraud - especially given the fact that management is just rolling out the drug, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty. Furthermore, infusions are bouncing back and there is strong demand. The stock dropping 45% is not good for previous shareholders, but it is very good for new buyers.

**Edit 2:** I am not a bag-holder, I just recently entered the stock. One notable bag holder is billionaire biotech investor Wayne Rothbaum (who sits on the board) though!

**Edit 3:** Outdated info but short interest is \~27% of float with 9 days to cover. Institutional ownership is 83.18%.

**Edit 4:** I have not sold a single share, and do not plan on selling until stock approaches my price target, or unless there is a material adverse development related to the company. Time horizon is 0.5-2 years.

**Edit 5:** Here is an excellent video from the Director of Melanoma Medical Oncology at the Stanford Cancer Center discussing the therapy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvr10OA_DJc.

1kq0ugj,What a UAE Deal Might Mean For SMCI,66,24,"This has been a pretty eventful week for SMCI and the AI sector as a whole. the acquisition of a [$20 billion deal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/saudis-datavolt-signs-20bn-deal-with-supermicro/) with DataVolt in Saudi Arabia and a 39% jump in share price off the strength of the news and overall AI sentiment improving is enough to make any degen hard as solid veiny diamonds. One thing this week that has especially caught my eye is UAE's plan to construct a [5GW AI Campus](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/05/uae-and-us-presidents-attend-unveiling-phase-1-new-5gw-ai-campus-abu), with the help of G42, that will house 5GW worth of data center racks and span **10 square miles**.

To put this into perspective, thats:

* 50k 100kW full-scale liquid-cooled racks
* 3.2 **million** Nvidia Blackwell (B100) chips
* More power than NYC and San Francisco **combined**
* Equivalent to powering **3-4 million** homes or running **50 million** gaming PCs at full power 24/7

As you can see, this is an insanely ambitious feat the UAE is trying to achieve. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but ask myself, of the roughly 50k racks the UAE plans to procure, how many of those racks will be SMCI? Furthermore, whatever amount of racks SMCI does provide, how much money does SMCI stand to make from the project? Most importantly, What does that mean for the share price?

First, we need to understand what DCBBS is, and how it actually benefits customers with large scale projects like the UAE AI Campus.

DCBBS stands for **Direct Connect Backplane Building Block Solutions**, and it‚Äôs SMCI's proprietary system architecture for building **full AI racks,** not just individual servers. This means when a customer selects which AI rack configuration they want, when it arrives at their door, it comes in a form [like this](https://trendspider.com/blog/dell-and-super-micro-power-musks-ai-ambitions/). In other words, customers are getting Kitchen-Aid refrigerators sent to their fucking door that contain 30-90 Nvidia Blackwell chips and liquid cooling systems within them. No more receiving your SMCI rack order in individual server pieces that you have to assemble on your own. This greatly increases the speed in which these new data centers can go live. In most cases, these racks can be installed and plugged in in **under a day.**

Additionally, this also helps to increase their margins over time.

Traditionally, SMCI sold servers as modular building blocks. things like:

* 1U and 2U server chassis
* Motherboards
* Power supplies
* GPU trays

Customers (like system integrators, VARs, or hyperscalers) would assemble these into racks themselves. That‚Äôs low-margin business, because you‚Äôre selling parts, not solutions. the DCBBS racks contain:

* CPU & GPU servers (e.g., Nvidia Blackwell, AMD EPYC, Intel Gaudi)
* Total liquid cooling (cold plates, manifolds, chillers, etc.)
* Network switches
* Rack management software
* Power distribution units (PDUs)

Why does this new model increase margins? Because it is a shift SMCI is making, from selling modular pieces that must be assembled, to selling complete solutions that are pre-assembled and ready for use upon arrival. This gives SMCI increased pricing power and in turn, increased margins. Below is a comparison table to illustrate the logic:

|Old Model (Per Server)|Rack-Scale Model (Per Rack)|
|:-|:-|
|Sell parts separately|Sell the full system integration|
|$5K‚Äì$15K ASP/server|$250K‚Äì$2M ASP per rack|
|6‚Äì10% gross margin|**15‚Äì25%+ gross margin**|
|Low-value add|**Turnkey AI solution** = premium pricing|

Now lets go more in depth:

**1. Higher Average Selling Price (ASP) per Unit**

* Traditional air-cooled servers sell for **$10K‚Äì$50K** each.
* Liquid-cooled **DCBBS racks** (often 64‚Äì96 GPUs) sell for **$2‚Äì5 million per rack**.
* Even if gross margins stay in the 8‚Äì10% range, **gross profit per rack is 40√ó‚Äì80√ó higher** than per-server sales.

Higher ASP = greater dollar-margin per unit sold, allowing SMCI to increase overall margins even with a similar percentage.

**2. Bundled Value = Control Over Margin Levers**

With DCBBS, SMCI is not just selling a server, it‚Äôs delivering:

* 8‚Äì12 liquid-cooled GPU servers
* 2000+ liquid-cooled racks a month
* Integrated CDUs (coolant distribution units)
* Power delivery + networking
* Cabling, plumbing, and chassis integration
* Software/BIOS optimization

All of these are designed, manufactured, and **assembled in-house**, which means:

1. Vertical integration reduces dependency on low-margin commodity components
2. Custom bundles let SMCI charge more for value-added services
3. Standardization improves yield, reduces warranty risk, and shortens labor cycles

**3. Faster Time-to-Deployment = Premium Pricing Power**

SMCI can ship **fully integrated, plug-and-play racks in 3‚Äì4 weeks**, while others take 8‚Äì12 weeks+ with multiple vendors.

For hyperscalers and AI startups racing to bring GPU clusters online, this **speed translates into willingness to pay more**, or at least not negotiate down.

For example: A customer buying a $2.5M rack from SMCI may avoid:

* Extra $500k/month in AI cloud rental costs
* 3‚Äì4 month delay in deploying AI training models
* Facility delays in retrofitting for traditional HVAC-based servers

Below is a table below comparing liquid-cooled racks Time-to-Deployment between SMCI and its competitors:

|**Vendor**|**Liquid-Cooled Rack Output (Est.)**|**Time to Deployment**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SMCI**|**\~2,000+ racks/month**|**3‚Äì4 weeks** (from factory)|DCBBS fully integrated, scalable, Blackwell-ready|
|**Dell**|*Unknown (not disclosed)*|\~6‚Äì10 weeks (unverified)|IR7000 liquid-cooled racks for hyperscalers, but no output figures released|
|**HPE**|*Limited modular deployments*|\~8‚Äì12 weeks (pods)|Offers liquid-cooled AI systems (e.g. Cray EX, Apollo), but mostly for supercomputing clients|
|**Lenovo**|*Unknown*|6+ weeks (via FIS programs)|Neptune liquid cooling, but most integration is not turnkey at SMCI pace|

This ‚Äútime-value‚Äù premium enhances margin per contract.

**4. Liquid Cooling = Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Clients**

Clients benefit from:

* 30‚Äì50%+ reduction in power usage (no fans/blowers at server level)
* Higher rack density ‚Üí fewer racks ‚Üí less real estate
* Reduced HVAC burden ‚Üí capex + opex savings

Because DCBBS racks are pre-validated and ready for 80‚Äì100+ kW loads, customers can safely go denser per rack ‚Äî which:

* Makes SMCI‚Äôs per-rack offering more economically valuable
* Lets them preserve pricing vs. air-cooled OEMs like Lenovo, HPE, or Dell, who may cut prices to remain competitive

Higher value-to-customer means more pricing power = higher gross margin

**5. Operational Efficiency at Scale**

SMCI is building out:

* A 3 million square foot manufacturing campus in Silicon Valley and Malaysia
* A supply chain optimized for GPU pre-allocation, liquid cooling parts, and just-in-time rack assembly

This allows SMCI to:

* Mass produce racks with minimal retooling
* Reduce per-rack cost at high volume
* Use contract-based repeat orders (like the DataVolt $20B deal) to plan capacity

Economies of scale + predictable assembly processes = declining cost/unit ‚Üí rising margin

Below is a comparison table illustrating the margin impact:

|**Advantage**|**Margin Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|High ASP per rack|Higher gross profit in dollar terms|
|Bundled hardware/services|Increases perceived value + vertical profit|
|Speed to deploy (3-4 weeks)|Pricing premium vs. slower OEMs|
|Energy/cooling savings for customer|Improves TCO ‚Üí preserves SMCI pricing power|
|Factory integration at scale|Lowers per-rack cost with volume|

So far, we've learned how DCBBS can substantially decrease build times for customers and how it could potentially increase margins for SMCI.

Now to the fun part: The UAE Deal

After doing some ape fisted carpet eating math, I estimate that the total cost of the 5GW AI Campus would be about $125 billion (assuming **each rack** draws about 100kW and sells for $2.5 million). Based on these numbers, I had ChatGPT build a table with a break down of what SMCI would get based on various percentages of the project they would be responsible for and superimposed a likelihood of occurrence formula in there:

|Coverage %|Likelihood of Occurrence|Racks Provided|G42 Total Payment to SMCI|Estimated Gross Profit (USD) 9.7%|Estimated EBITDA (USD)|Estimated EPS|Implied Share Price (@20x PE)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1%|Highly Likely (90%)|500|$1,250,000,000|$121,250,000|$103,062,500|$1.87|$37.40|
|2%|Very Likely (80%)|1000|$2,500,000,000|$242,500,000|$206,125,000|$3.75|$75.00|
|5%|Likely (65%)|2500|$6,250,000,000|$606,250,000|$515,312,500|$9.37|$187.40|
|10%|Possible (45%)|5000|$12,500,000,000|$1,212,500,000|$1,030,625,000|$18.74|$374.80|
|25%|Plausible (25%)|12500|$31,250,000,000|$3,031,250,000|$2,576,562,500|$46.84|$936.80|
|50%|Unlikely (10%)|25000|$62,500,000,000|$6,062,500,000|$5,153,125,000|$93.70|$1,874.00|
|100%|Very Unlikely (3%)|50000|$125,000,000,000|$12,125,000,000|$10,306,250,000|$187.40|$3,748.00|

As you can see, even with a conservative PE of 20x and 9.7% margins, if SMCI gets even 2-5% of the project, thats an EPS of $3.75-9.37 and a share price of $75-187 a share.

**How ChatGPT Calculated the Likelihoods**

This wasn‚Äôt a statistical model but rather a strategic probability estimate based on 5 weighted factors:

**1. Historical Precedent (30%)**

* No hyperscaler or government has ever given 100% of a 5GW AI deployment to one vendor.
* Datavolt gave SMCI a $20B deal, but likely part of a larger multi-phase build ‚Äî suggesting up to 25% is plausible.

**2. Industry Norm for Diversification (25%)**

* Large clients (e.g. AWS, G42, Meta) **split procurement across 2‚Äì4 OEMs** for risk mitigation, price leverage, and geopolitical hedging.
* Most national-scale AI campuses split rack-scale work among **Dell, Lenovo, HPE, SMCI, Nvidia integrators**, etc.

**3. SMCI Production Capacity (20%)**

* SMCI can output \~5,000 racks/month total, **2,000+ liquid cooled**.
* To hit 50‚Äì100% coverage of a 5GW facility, they‚Äôd need to commit 6‚Äì12 months of global capacity, which limits probability unless it's multi-year.

**4. Geopolitical Alignment (15%)**

* SMCI already has deep regional partnerships (Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi), so 10‚Äì25% is well within reach.
* But **50‚Äì100%** would likely require **exclusive national alignment**, which is rare unless the vendor is sovereign or majority-owned.

**5. First-Mover Advantage & Time-to-Deploy (10%)**

* SMCI‚Äôs lead time (3‚Äì4 weeks vs. 8‚Äì12 weeks) is a massive advantage.
* For urgency-sensitive contracts, this could **justify awarding 25% or more** ‚Äî but not 100%, barring a disruption in Dell/HPE supply.

I think its also important to add, two job listenings have been posted for positions in Abu Dhabi:

[Account Sales Manager](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Sales-Account-Manager/1148026500/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Technology Enablement Engineer](https://jobs.supermicro.com/job/United-Arab-Emirates-Abu-Dha-Technology-Enablement-Engineer/1246502400/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)



All in all, SMCI could stand to make a assload of money from a G42 UAE deal.

Last but not least, Cramer is [‚ÄúSick of‚Äù](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/jim-cramer-is-sick-of-super-micro-computer-stock-should-you-sell-smci-now/ar-AA1F0NkN?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds) SMCI

  
TL:DR: SMCI provides the fastest Time-to-Deployment of any of its competitors with its liquid-cooled DCBBS solution and this could help increase margins overtime and make it a more attractive buy to larger customers ready to deploy immediately. Capturing even 5% of the G42 UAE deal could result in a share price of $180+ a share. SMCI is already hiring for positions in Abu Dhabi.

Here‚Äôs Why The Stock Could Fly:,540,304,"Despite some people calling me a Permabear after I made a killing after Liberation Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/fT9ephmvL0) and also shorting BRK.B (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/kzUQT0EsA9), I've also had some great success this year being a Bull, most recently with OKLO (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/RjAq1SBqSn).

My new favorite trade is also a bullish play:  UNH

I have many reasons to be bullish on UNH.

In no particular order:

1. INSIDER BUYING:  In the last three trading days, Insiders at UNH have bought $31.6 million worth of shares with $30 million of that coming from the CEO and CFO. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key transactions:

‚Ä¢ Timothy Patrick Flynn (Independent Director) purchased 1,533 shares on May 14, 2025, at $320.80 per share, totaling approximately $491,786.

‚Ä¢ Kristen Gil (Director) bought 3,700 shares on May 16, 2025, at $271.17 per share, amounting to about $1,003,290

‚Ä¢ John Noseworthy (Director) acquired 300 shares on May 14, 2025, at $312.16 per share, for approximately $93,648

‚Ä¢ Additional insider purchases, including significant buys by the CEO (86,700 shares at $288.57 for approximately $25,019,019) and President/CFO (17,175 shares at $291.12 for approximately $4,999,986), were reported on May 16, 2025.

‚ÄúShow me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.‚Äù ‚Äî Charlie Munger

No better incentive for number go up than Insiders putting more skin in the game to ensure this happens.

2. JIM CRAMER IS BEARISH:  Presented without comment (https://x.com/jimcramer/status/1923018153350631806?s=46&t=zA11beG1ZvqVrorBODhs-g)

3.  DOJ INVESTIGATION LIKELY A SNOOZE:  Fellow redditor u/chrislink73 provided an excellent breakdown for why the DOJ case is pretty weak: https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/ZO8AUearjn 

Furthermore, even if the case isn‚Äôt dismissed, it could take many months if not years (factoring in appeals) to resolve.  The most likely outcome other than the judge dismissing the case is a settlement where UNH pays a few billion dollars and life moves on.  Wall Street Banks have been doing this for years since the GFC and investors just don‚Äôt really care.

4.  ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VITAL COMPANIES:  UNH is the most important healthcare company in the US.  Some stats:

- Covers 50 million people
- $410B in annual revenues 
- 400,000 employees
- 90,000 doctors in the network

Said differently:  Too Big To Fail.

5.  U.S. DEBT DOWNGRADE MAKES UNH A FLIGHT TO SAFETY:  Historically, UNH has been a defensive play in times of tumult.  Given how oversold it is, UNH could be sought out as a safehaven again, with money coming out of the Nasdaq darlings and into UNH.  On the flip side, Moody's and S&P Global already downgraded the US before and we hit ATH anyways.  UNH would likely benefit in this scenario as well.  Heads I win.  Tails I win.

6.  V-SHAPED RECOVERIES ARE THE NEW NORM:  Go look up charts of the major stock indices during the COVID Crash (March 2020), Silicon Valley Bank Panic (March 2023), Japanese Yen Carry Trade Crash (August 2024), Liberation Day Crash (April 2025).  What do all of these crashes have in common?  They were short-lived and all had insane V-shaped recoveries.  I think the same phenomenon may occur with UNH.

7.  GAPS TO FILL:  With UNH down over 50% in 1 month, there are some major gaps to fill:  $305, $375, $503, $580.

8.  FUNDAMENTALS ATTRACTIVE:  Wall Street will probably coalesce around EPS of $28 for 2026.  If you use a conservative MCO (Managed Care Org.) multiple of 13x, this gets you a PT of $364.  I think this is a conservative estimate.

9.  BUFFETT BUY POTENTIAL:  I have no information to substantiate this but UNH strikes me as the exact type of company Buffett would buy at a sizable discount:  Dow Jones Industrial bellwether, Huge competitive moat, systemically important company in the U.S., heavily involved with the insurance business which is what BRK.B specializes in, and massive FCF ($20.71B of FCF in 2024).

10.  MEMES GONNA MEME:  With soft macro data showing the economy is likely slowing, I believe retail investors are more determined than ever to try to ride the wave of the next meme to outpace any broader economic slowdown whether it be a result of stagflation, job losses, or anything else ""out of their control"".  With large institutions dumping UNH, this is the perfect opportunity for the Regular Joe to accumulate a position in one of the most important companies in America at a massive discount.  I think the rocket ship has only just taken off.  

I could be wrong about all of this and UNH continues to tank.  This is not financial advice.  I'm gonna shoot my shot.  Good luck out there.",1747587814.0
1kpl8uq,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Set to Speak at Computex Sunday‚ÄîWhat You Need To Know,138,33,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to take the stage this Sunday at Computex, an annual technology trade show, with this year‚Äôs theme‚Äî‚ÄúAI Next‚Äù‚Äîfocused squarely on the emerging technology that has lately powered growth in the company's business.

Huang‚Äôs keynote, which will be livestreamed from Taipei‚Äôs Music Center at 11 p.m. ET Sunday, is expected to highlight Nvidia‚Äôs latest advances, and may bring announcements of new partnerships.

Shares of the AI chipmaker‚Äôs stock were little changed Friday. They‚Äôve added roughly 15% this week as a Saudi Arabian partnership announced Tuesday during President Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East raised hopes for future deals. The recent gains have helped Nvidia shares edge back into positive territory for the year. The potential for new announcements at Computex could present another catalyst for the stock, along with the company's first-quarter earnings report due May 28.

At last year‚Äôs Computex, Nvidia had announced the successor to its Blackwell AI chip, known as Rubin, sending shares higher. Huang in March said Rubin is still set to launch in 2026.

""We would expect relatively positive news on the AI front out of Computex next week,"" Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Friday.

Other chipmakers are also scheduled to present later in the week, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) set to showcase its latest developments on Tuesday.

**Retail Chain Reports in Focus Amid Tariff Questions**

Investors will watch retail earnings for signs of consumer weakening amid reports of declining sentiment and concerns that¬†tariffs could drive prices higher. Several noteworthy tech, travel, and medical companies are also on this week‚Äôs calendar.

Home Depot‚Äôs scheduled report for Tuesday comes after the hardware retailer's¬†weaker-than-expected outlook¬†in the previous quarter, even as its quarterly results topped analyst estimates. The home improvement giant said it expected to grow sales by 2.8% in 2025, lower than the 3.27% expected from analysts tracking the company, who are surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its expected¬†comparable store sales¬†growth below 1% also undershot estimates.

Rival hardware seller Lowe‚Äôs expected report the following day comes after it too delivered better-than-expected quarterly sales, but its¬†guidance for 2025¬†came in under Visible Alpha estimates.

The expected report from Target on Wednesday comes after it warned in early March that uncertainty around tariffs could¬†weigh on its current-quarter earnings, even as the retailer posted comparable store sales results above projections at 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Discount retailer TJX's scheduled Wednesday report comes as the TJ Maxx parent also¬†delivered a disappointing outlook¬†for the quarter just ended, while rival discount chain Ross Stores is on Thursday‚Äôs calendar along with fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

Cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks is expected to report on Tuesday after its last¬†quarterly results were boosted by AI adoption, including cloud investment and infrastructure modernization. Cloud software provider Snowflake‚Äôs report, scheduled for Wednesday, comes as it also reported¬†strong results on demand for AI products¬†in the prior period.

International travel service provider [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and Irish airline Ryanair are on Monday‚Äôs corporate calendar, which, along with Tuesday‚Äôs report from cruise line Viking, will give investors insight into consumer travel demand.

Investors will also be following Wednesday‚Äôs expected release from XPeng, a¬†Chinese electric vehicle maker¬†that competes with Tesla (TSLA) in that country. Other noteworthy reports this week include homebuilder Toll Brothers on Tuesday, medical device maker Medtronic on Wednesday, and tax software provider Intuit on Thursday.

**Fed Speakers Scheduled as Central Bank Faces Pressure on Rates**

Several Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, shortly after President Trump criticized the central bank‚Äôs decisions to¬†keep interest rates unchanged. The Fed has said it is monitoring the economic impact of tariffs as it reviews¬†incoming data on inflation¬†and the labor market.

An Atlanta Federal Reserve event on Monday and Tuesday will feature Fed Vice Chair Jefferson, Atlanta Fed President Bostic, Dallas Fed President Logan, San Francisco Fed President Daly, and Cleveland Fed President Hammack. Federal Reserve Gov. Bowman and New York Fed President Williams are among other Fed representatives expected to appear this week.

Market watchers will be tuned in to home-seller data this week, as reports for existing and new home sales are expected. The data comes as¬†home sales have been sluggish¬†amid¬†high interest rates and challenging inventory.

Investors are also expected to focus on jobless-claim numbers on Thursday, while the S&P Global flash¬†Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)¬†will provide an early look at how the manufacturing and services sectors are faring so far in May.¬†",1747567666.0

Well, this happened a lot faster than I expected... after selling all of my holdings of UVIX, I dumped the 650k into leveraged ETFs, thinking that the market is more likely to recover than to keep going down. This worked out quite well for me, since the market has rallied from SPY 530 to 595. Since most of the recovery happened in tech stocks, my TQQQ grew quite nicely:

This post has mostly been more or less a follow-up on how I've been doing since a lot of people in the comments of the last post were telling me that I'm being dumb with my money and that the rally was just  a dead-cat bounce.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i\_allind\_and\_held\_400k\_in\_uvix\_for\_6\_months\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jwdal8/i_allind_and_held_400k_in_uvix_for_6_months_i/)

Although, with SPY close to 600, I will sell off \~50% of my leveraged ETFs and put them into ETFs, then await to see how the rest of the tariff negotiations go. If they go poorly, I will probably put the leveraged 50% into SPXU/SQQQ (as opposed to UVIX). I don't anticipate the market to do a steep drop similar to liberation day, since it seems like any new tariff deals we get won't be worse than what was initially revealed, so I'm cautiously optimistic about the market eventually reaching ATH, but not ruling out the possibility that we'll reverse down again within the next 1-2 months.

It has been quite surreal to +133% my portfolio off of 2 gambles, and I hope to keep being able to pull this off and maintain my millionaire status after Uncle Sam takes his cut.

1knub4h,NBIS will be the next Palantir,115,102,"NBIS remain undervalued.

Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a leading AI infrastructure company with several key investment highlights:

1. Strong Revenue Growth: 

Nebius reported a significant revenue increase to $43.3 million in Q3 2024 from $5 million the previous year, driven by surging demand for AI infrastructure. The company projects an annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) of $750 million to $1 billion by year-end 2025, up from $90 million in December 2024.

2. Jensen Huang and Jeff Bezos

Strategic Investments: Nebius secured a $700 million private placement in December 2024 from high-profile investors, including NVIDIA, Accel, and Orbis Investments, at a 3% premium to the stock‚Äôs average price. This capital supports its expansion, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, Bezos Expeditions invested $72 million in Nebius‚Äô AI data business, Toloka, in May 2025, enhancing its growth potential

3. Infrastructure Expansion

Nebius is investing over $1 billion by mid-2025 to build AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters in Kansas City, New Jersey (300 MW campus), and Paris, with plans to triple its Finland data center capacity. It leverages NVIDIA‚Äôs latest GPUs (H200, Blackwell) for high-performance AI

4. AI-Centric Platform

Nebius offers a full-stack AI infrastructure, including an AI-native cloud platform and Nebius AI Studio for inference-as-a-service, designed for the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its proprietary technology and 850 AI engineers provide a competitive edge

5. Analyst Optimism

Analysts from DA Davidson ($35price target) and BWS Financial ($51) have issued ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings, citing Nebius‚Äô strategic positioning and infrastructure investments. Citron Research projects a $60 share price, calling it an ‚ÄúAI Wall Street darling‚Äù due to its NVIDIA partnership and undervaluation compared to peers like CoreWeave.

6. Financial Position

With nearly $3 billion in cash reserves post-fundraise and minimal debt, Nebius is well-funded to execute its growth plans, despite current unprofitability.

7. Diverse Portfolio

Beyond its core AI cloud, Nebius operates Toloka (140% revenue growth in 2024), TripleTen (edtech), and Avride (autonomous driving), creating a robust AI ecosystem.

8. Clickhouse 28% ownership 

valuation soared to 6 billion potentially making nebius holdings worth 1.7 billion$

9. AV ride autonomous software, robotaxis and robot deliveries fund raising. AVride likely in top 3 spot in autonomous driving. Partnerships includes Hyundai, Uber eats, grubhub, rakuten.

1knowns,Why should I not short Footlocker and put the proceeds into SGOV?,39,51,"Dicks (DKS) announced today that it is looking to buy Footlocker (FL) for 24 dollars a share. In response, Footlocker shot up 80ish percent to 23.90 dollars a share. Until the deal goes through, Footlocker stock won't go above 24. That's a 0.4% spread, and the current cost to borrow Footlocker is 0.27%. The merger would have to close in less than two months to match the risk-free rate. Mergers aren't that fast. What's to stop me from shorting it and sticking the resulting cash into SGOV? If the deal falls through I make money off of Footlocker's stock plummeting, and if the deal doesn't go through I make money off the interest arb. I can't see any risks here other than the fastest merger in history or getting margin called. What am I missing? There's no way institutions haven't noticed this.

1kng0az,The Yen carry trade isn't over,279,58,"G'day, 

In early August 2024 we all remember the ""yen carry trade unwind"" tanked our stock market and led to incredible volatility, with the VIX hitting a remarkable intraday high of **65.**  

The yen carry trade is still affecting our stock market. The below chart is the SPY (candles) overlayed with the USD:JPY (line). The USD:JPY is currently at \~145, which is similar to it's value back in August. 

  
Also of note the USD:JPY hit it's recent low on April 22nd at 138...the same day stocks bottomed. 

  
Considering all of the above, I suggest that the USD:JPY is correlated with US stock prices and should be a key thing to watch. Most interesting of all we've started to diverge from this correlation in recent days with the USD:JPY trending lower while since the 12th of May while the S&P trades higher. To me, this means that one of the two trends is ""wrong"", and we'll soon see a correction of stocks lower or a correction of the yen higher. 

The Japanese central bank is currently in a rate hiking cycle with rates at 0.50%, the highest in many years. However their rate hike campaign will be paused until September pending a trade deal with the US. Keep an eye on a potential trade deal or any reason that could cause Yen devaluation. A bearish yen is bearish for US stocks as Japan has been the source of cheap liquidity for 15 years+... will take a long time to unwind this trade.

(Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods was nearing a deal to buy rival footwear retailer Foot Locker for about $2.3 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The companies have discussed a deal at $24 per share for Foot Locker, the report said. That would represent an 86.5% premium to the stock's last closing price.

Shares of Foot Locker surged 62.32% in extended trading, while Dick's Sporting Goods was down about 5%.

The deal could be finalized as soon as Thursday, the report said.

The companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

1kmqw0p,PSN - Undervalued Defense & Infrastructure Contractor With Asymmetric Upside,13,8,"Repost as I didn't add a screenshot of my position in the initial post

# Introduction:

* Parsons (NYSE: PSN) is a $7B U.S. company specializing in infrastructure, defense, and cybersecurity services
* They were named in a new¬†**U.S.‚ÄìQatar deal involving up to $97B in projects**, but details on their specific share are still unclear
* Stock trades at¬†**\~9x forward EV/EBITDA**, while peers trade at¬†**11.5x‚Äì12.5x**

# What Parsons Does:

Parsons operates in two main segments:

1. **Critical Infrastructure**¬†Airports, transportation systems, water, environmental infrastructure, smart cities
2. **Federal Solutions**¬†Cybersecurity, missile defense, intelligence, systems engineering for the U.S. government

They serve public-sector clients in high-barrier, long-cycle markets with a focus on digital and national security transformation.

# Qatar Deal: The Known and the Unknown

* On May 14, the White House announced a¬†**$243B U.S.‚ÄìQatar commercial agreement**
* **Parsons was listed as securing 30 projects worth ‚Äúup to $97B‚Äù**
* However, the¬†**actual scope, timing, and revenue contribution remain undisclosed**

# Why It Matters:

* Parsons‚Äô¬†**entire market cap is \~$7B**
* If even¬†**10‚Äì15%**¬†of those Qatar projects convert into backlog or revenue, it could¬†**materially change the company‚Äôs growth profile**
* The announcement is¬†**public knowledge**, but the¬†**market is waiting for details**¬†‚Äî which creates a pricing disconnect

# Peer Comparison

|Company|EV/EBITDA|YoY Revenue Growth|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|||||
|**PSN**|\~9x|\+1%|Large backlog, Qatar exposure|
|KBR|\~11.5x|\+6%|U.S. defense + tech|
|AECOM|\~12x|\+9%|Infrastructure focus|
|Jacobs (J)|\~12.5x|\+11%|Infrastructure + ESG + gov‚Äôt|

Despite similar business models, Parsons trades at a discount due to:

* Slower recent revenue growth
* Investor uncertainty around backlog conversion

# Valuation Opportunity:

* PSN FY2025 EBITDA guide: \~$675M
* Peer average multiple: \~12.25x
   * Implied EV with the same multiple: \~$8.3B ‚Üí Implied stock price: $77‚Äì78/share
   * Current price: \~$67 ‚Üí 15‚Äì20% undervalued
   * If Qatar contracts are confirmed, stock could re-rate to $85‚Äì90+
   * Stock was trading at $112 back in November
      * Historical prices aren't usually great arguments for why a stock is undervalued but it shows that there is history of significant price movement in the stock despite it being a boring government defense contracting company

# The Setup:

* Backlog at $9.1B (record high) ‚Äî offers multi-year revenue visibility (without factoring in the Qatar deal)
* Net income up 67% YoY, indicating margin expansion
* Next earnings could bring clarity on:
   * Qatar backlog contribution
   * Revenue acceleration
   * Updated revenue guidance

# Risks:

* If Qatar projects stall or remain vague, sentiment may stay muted
   * I doubt this will happen since I'm sure this will be brought up through the next investors call
* Revenue growth needs to pick up to justify peer-level multiples
* Execution risk in managing large-scale international contracts
   * Despite being at record high backlog, there may be questions about whether or not the company can convert fast enough to address that backlog of work (though all defense companies have massive backlogs)

# My Position:

* Long¬†**Sept 2025 $85 calls @ $1.50**¬†‚Äî low-risk exposure to upside catalysts
   * Though I recommend holding the underlying as well
* I expect a¬†**re-rating as visibility improves**, with upside over the next 3‚Äì9 months

# Final Take

Parsons is trading like a low-growth contractor ‚Äî but its¬†**financials, margin trends, and strategic positioning**¬†suggest otherwise.

Overall Parsons is a company that has the following:

* Real cash flow
* Exposure to $97B in announced international projects
* A stock at a¬†**discount to peers**¬†with upside leverage through contracts and guidance",1747257609.0

1kmn49v,The emotional chaos of selling a stock that‚Äôs ripping - Advice on taking profits,158,86,"I don‚Äôt think enough people talk about how hard it is to sell when you‚Äôre actually up big on a position.

Everyone‚Äôs always focused on the entry. What‚Äôs the next 5x? What are you buying? But honestly, I‚Äôve found the real challenge is knowing what to do once something you own starts ripping.

I‚Äôve had this happen a few times now. I‚Äôd get in early on something, maybe just messing around with a small position, and then suddenly it‚Äôs up 200%, 300%, sometimes more. And I‚Äôd love to say I calmly trimmed, locked in profit, and moved on. But that‚Äôs not how it went.

Usually you start getting emotional. You feel smart. You tell yourself it‚Äôs going higher. You start thinking about what your gain could be if you just held a little longer. Sometimes you even add more. I‚Äôve done that. Then it pulls back 40%, and now you‚Äôre stuck. Selling feels wrong. Holding feels worse. You just sit there watching it bleed.

One thing that‚Äôs helped me is trying to think of selling the same way I think about buying. When a position gets big and my portfolio value starts growing fast, I‚Äôll stop and ask: ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt own this stock right now, would I be comfortable putting this amount of money into it at this current price and chart?‚Äù

Most of the time, the answer is no. That‚Äôs when I know I probably need to trim. I don‚Äôt want one name becoming way too outsized just because I‚Äôm emotionally tied to it. Rebalancing feels more like a risk management decision than some emotional call to dump the stock. And honestly, it helps a lot.

Another thing is selling in chunks. I might trim a bit after a double. More if it keeps going. That way I‚Äôm locking something in but still giving it room to run. I try not to beat myself up if it goes higher after I sell. That‚Äôs just part of the game.

I‚Äôve still made plenty of mistakes. I‚Äôve round-tripped some great trades because I got greedy or froze. But I‚Äôm starting to learn that having some kind of exit mindset early on makes everything easier. Even just writing down a rough plan or price target helps take the edge off when it comes time to decide.

Anyway, just sharing my experience. If you‚Äôve ever held too long, sold too early, or felt stuck on what to do when you‚Äôre up big, you‚Äôre definitely not the only one. Curious how other people think about this stuff too.",1747248470.0

Last earnings report, walmart lowered their guidance and **expected to lose money this quarter because of** ***Tariffs*****.** I am making this post not because of tariffs, but because of ***Deportations***. I will not be taking any stances in this post--just talking about the theoretical impact on their revenue.

  
So to start, let's get some basic demographics down. In the United States, around 18.9% of the US and are the second largest racial/ethnic group after nonhispanic whites. Below is a photo to show the ten states with the largest representation of hispanics. There are an estimated 62 million hispanics.

[California and Texas are the biggest two. Going all the way down to Arizona and New Mexico. ](https://preview.redd.it/nsxgzi47xr0f1.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0038e0dd29896216fbaa52122b6d00bc72db63)

So now we need to look at Walmart's consumer data. Walmart estimates that about .14 of their customers are hispanic. Now, this [website](https://www.contimod.com/walmart-statistics/#:~:text=Walmart%20serves%20over%2037%20million,6.25%25%20from%202023%20to%202024\) has a bunch of other data on the consumer that you could look at if you want to, but these are the important numbers.

  
**The Impact on expedited deportations**

  
According to this [website](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation), illegal immigrants produce quite a significant chunk of the US economy. The immigrants usually pick agriculture or construction work and pay quite a bit to businesses and our governments without receiving benefits like a citizen would. I don't think I need to say, but if agriculture product is harder to get, that leads to slower supply lines, leading to higher demand, leading to higher prices to offset the cost, not to mention the inflation we've already been seeing. Simple supply and Demand.

  
**This part is speculation**

  
I live in a town with a large number of hispanic people here. Me hablo un poco espa√±ol de colegio. This, just as a source, wouldn't suffice because anecdotal evidence is fallacious. That being said, let's do a thought experiment. Let's say our non english or little english-speaking amigos see that ICE are ramping up deportations, xenophobia is rising and the hispanics are experiencing more of that, etc etc. How do you think they are going to act? I think that if they fear deportation, are upset with xenophobia, and want to stay as ""safe"" from ICE as possible, they will stay with hispanic areas as much as possible. This will drive away revenue from previous places they were shopping at and create small business opportunities with their friends/family that do have legal status and can open shops. My speculation is that walmart did not account for a drop in hispanic customers when they lowered their guidance last quarter. So let's do some math.

  
Walmart has 8 billion shares in its company and netted 5.254 bill in income. With division, this comes to .65675 or .66 EPS. They lowered their guidance last quarter to .59 EPS for this quarter from tariffs affecting goods. Now, I think that some very educated people know their stuff and I will not argue with that number based on tariffs. I think that tariffs and inflation probably did have a big effect on walmart. However, I do want to show some speculative math here. Let's say that the .14 or 14% of their hispanic customers dropped to 10% this quarter which is a pretty big jump, that will have changed their income to 4.729Bill or 

**.591125 or .59 EPS**. Now I don't have many metrics I would need for better estimation such as average ticket, cost of goods, etc. but that EPS is not accounting for tariffs. 

  
**Positions**

I have two walmart 93$ Puts expiring on 5/23.

I have also prepared my banbet on the daily thread when I was up at 2 lmao. 

TLDR: Walmart will miss estimates because of a drop in hispanic customers. Buy puts

1kmjl1x,Stock trading app eToro opens at $69.69 in Nasdaq debut,252,52,Nice...,1747240126.0
1kmjjbn,"This market is disgustingly overpriced, and we are due for a correction similar to what we saw during Dot Com/Global financial crisis.",2011,1305,"I want to preface this by stating that I legitimately home someone can refute what I have to say here. I take no pleasure in the thought of people's 401k's and IRA's and pension funds getting absolutely decimated, and this post has nothing to do with politics... I think the market has been overpriced for a long time (+/- 8 years), and it is only getting worse.

**Some quick points:**

**1. Price to earnings ratio**

Price to earnings ratio is at the point of absolute lunacy. The S&P 500 is over 28 today, and before the market started correcting in February, we were actually over 31. The Nasdaq is at 37 and was as high as 44. While I imagine most in this subreddit at least have a grasp of what P/E means -- for those that don't -- here's a quick summary. For purposes of this post, let's use NVDA as an example. Assume NVDA didn't have a single penny in expenses. They didn't have to pay for employees. They had no rent. There was no salary for Jensen Huang, and they didn't have to pay a penny in taxes. They somehow got all their electricity for free, and they didn't even have a COGS (cost of goods sold) -- somehow they were getting all of their materials for free. Then also assume that their sales remained exactly where they are at today... that their revenue remained identical to where it is at today, and they took 100% of that revenue, and distributed it back among the shareholders of the company. Right now -- NVDA's P/E is at 45.43 -- meaning it would be 45 years before investors recouped their money.

The entire S&P is trading over 28 today... meaning if the +/- 500 largest companies in the USA didn't have a single expense, and continued generating the same revenue, it would take 28 years for investors to get their money back.

Who in the world would be interested in signing up for that ""investment"" opportunity? My own mother could call me asking me to invest in her company and I wouldn't invest based on that return.

**2. The Buffett indicator**

The Buffett indicator is a simple calculation of the total value of the US stock market divided by GDP.

Historically, that number has hung out right around 1-- meaning the total value of the US stock market should be roughly the same as GDP. Buffett himself stated a value of 75-90% is reasonable, and a value over 120% signals the market is overpriced. The highest the buffett indicator has ever hit was during the dot com bubble, when it was 2.1 standard deviations above the trendline. The highest until now, that is. The market value is currently 211% of GDP, or almost 70% above what historically has been seen as normal.

**3. The stock market is insanely top heavy.**

The Mag 7 currently account for 31% of the S&P 500, and over 40% of the Nasdaq. If these 7 stocks correct, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the market as a whole. We saw this play out during Dot Com with the likes of Cisco, Intel, and Oracle. While the market was top heavy then -- it was nowhere near as top heavy as it is today... In fact -- the top 10 most valuable companies now represent more than twice as much of a percentage of value in the market as the top 10 did when Dot Com crashed.

Side note -- but I do think investors have briefly taken note of this. So much of these companies is based on perceived future growth based on revenue that can/will be generated by AI. But remember what happened when DeepSeek emerged last year -- and alerted WallStreet that an incredibly sophisticated AI can be created without pouring billions of dollars into R&D and infrastructure? The market absolutely tanked. What if it becomes obvious that these AI plays will not be unique to the largest tech companies in the world, and that these systems can be developed by any mid-cap with a decent budget?

**4. Home prices and the Housing Market**

I won't dive too deep into this, but homes are more unaffordable today than at any point in US history. Based on median US income and Median US home price, right before the Global financial crisis/mortgage crisis of 08/09 -- this number hit it's highest point in US history -- 45%.

Its highest percent¬†*until*¬†the last 12 months. It now takes over 46% of a family's income to purchase a home.  
30% is the figure that is generally regarded as affordable.

The condo market is collapsing, particularly in Florida, where HOA dues and Insurance costs have made these properties completely unaffordable.

Foreclosures on FHA loans are also set to resume. Biden put in place a policy where anyone that wanted could simply apply for a mortgage payment deferment after COVID... meaning call your servicer, say you're experiencing a hardship, and they simply give you a deferral. None of these homes could be foreclosed upon. They then tack these payments on to the back end of the loan with the additional accrued interest. This policy still exists today, but is about to come to an end in September. As of Q1 2025, over 10.6% of all FHA mortgages are at least one payment late. Over 4% of FHA mortgages are over 90 days late.

What happens when FHA foreclosures absolutely flood the market?

What does this do to home prices, and even more importantly, what does this do to homebuilders? If inventory skyrockets (more than it already has over the last couple of months), and price pressure pushes everything down due to increased supply, will home builders still be able to make money? Homebuilding employs over 11 million americans... Plumbers, electricians, roofers, landscapers, drywallers, framers, truck drivers, etc --

When homes stop being built, unemployment skyrockets, and GDP shrinks dramatically.

**5. Consumer debt is through the roof**

Credit card debt is at the highest it's ever been, and delinquency rates are as high as they've been since emerging from the global financial crisis. Q4 of 2011 was the last time delinquency rates were this high.

Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been in decades.

**6. Bonds -- worldwide -- are pushing higher and higher.**

The US is getting hit here worse than most, as it seems people are not excited about Trump's game of chicken with tariffs. Nonetheless -- you are seeing bond yields push higher and higher worldwide, as investors demand higher returns for government bonds to account for their perceived risk. Interest rates cuts have not quelled this. Despite 100bps cuts in the federal funds rate since last year, the 10 year t-note is actually up 80 ticks since then.

**7. Commercial real estate**

A massive amount of commercial real-estate will need to be refinanced in the coming 12-24 months -- and you will see these payments skyrocket. Many holders of Commercial real-estate refinanced their properties in the quarters after COVID, when interest rates were incredibly low. Most of these loans are either done on 5-year balloons, or as adjustable rate mortgages. These owners will see their payments jump by 30,50, even 70% as they are forced to refinance these properties and interest rates that are close to double what they were last time. This will be compounded by the fact that many companies moved to work from home models, or at least partial work from home models. Office space vacancy rates have skyrocketed -- meaning less tenants -- all while mortgage payments on these properties is skyrocketing.

**8. Student Loan Debt**

The government's moratorium on student loan payments has officially come to an end. 43 million Americans that have been been able to avoid making payments on their average of $38k in student loan debt for the last 5+ years are now going to have to start making payments. Those that don't will see their credit score be absolutely decimated. What other payments will the begin to fall behind on? As I mentioned previously -- credit card delinquency rates and auto loan delinquency rates are already high -- and rising. How much worse does that get when 15% of the population beings adding a several hundred dollar payment to their expenses each month?

There is a dozen other items I could list here, but in the interest of actually getting some work done today, I'll leave my post there.

I would genuinely love for someone to refute places I'm missing the mark, or why I may be wrong about my assumptions above.

I know 99% of you idiots won‚Äôt read this, but for the rest:

* Stock dropped 98% but is far from bankrupt. It just refinanced its debt and has $1.1B capital, $693M cash, enough to weather the housing market for two years or more.
* Company has been downsizing and focusing on unit efficiency the past two years, following the Carvana restructuring playbook.
* Made a billion dollars flipping houses in 2021, but is struggling in a frozen housing market. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market Opendoor will start making money again.
* Has financing and staff to scale revenue by 3x, it's just waiting on the housing market
* Opendoor has been learning important things about how real estate works, like:
   * Real estate agents exist for a reason
   * Home prices go up in the summer
* Now that Opendoor knows how real estate works, it will make more money
* Opendoor is down in April because the hedge funds shorted it to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. When the ETFs tracking Russell sell their shares on June 27 and the shorts cover, Opendoor will probably go back up to $2.

Click[ here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNLPOVK7WborYt-Us1HThg1QCwyCbnJng1acrQAtoYa1iV6vd9-qFZZbdbU_SdEIbfFL9D98155zxk/pubhtml) for Opendoor‚Äôs financials in Google sheets.

**Change in business plan**:

Opendoor is a corporate home-buyer. They used to be in the business of buying homes at above market value, sitting on them a few months, then flipping them at a profit. This was a great business model in 2021, but not so good in 2022 when home prices stopped rising. Opendoor bought 35k homes that year, and ended up selling them for a billion dollar loss.

Since then, Opendoor has pivoted strategies, and now buys homes for about 10% less than they‚Äôre worth, then sells them at a profit. It‚Äôs actually a fair deal for customers: instead of paying 5% in agent fees and having to negotiate with buyers for months, they can pay 10% and skip the home selling process.

One problem though, is customers tend to overvalue their homes, so they tend to think Opendoor is overcharging them. A normal customer interaction goes like this:

1. Customer has a $500k house, and thinks it‚Äôs worth $600k
2. Customer goes to[ Opendoor.com](https://opendoor.com) and gets a quote for $450k
3. Customer thinks, ‚Äúhahahahahaha I knew these guys were crooks, they want $150k to sell my house, I‚Äôm selling with a realtor instead‚Äù
4. Realtor agrees Opendoor is a bunch of crooks, because realtor competes with Opendoor

It's been a truly terrible marketing funnel. Opendoor only converts 1% of its prospective customers at a cost of $14k per house.

The new business plan is this:

1. Customer goes to Opendoor
2. Opendoor says, would you like to talk to a local real estate agent?
3. Customer thinks, ""yes of course I don't trust you crooks""
4. Agent tries to convince the customer that Opendoor's offer isn't bad
5. If the customer sells, Opendoor wins. Otherwise, the agent sells the house, Opendoor collects a commission and still wins.

It's a much, much better business plan. Nobody wants to sell their house without talking to a real estate agent first, because they don't trust corporations. Now that Opendoor has figured that out, expect revenue to go up and marketing cost per house to go down.

**Opendoor no longer lighting as much money on fire**

Look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/f870nejv0p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ad9dc55bb34e1e364ac77fd85df1a0416af2723

Do you see where it says, profit per house, -$65k? That was the Zirp era. Home prices started going down, and the CEO decided he was going to buy even more of them at above market prices to capture the market. Thankfully, after lighting a billion dollars on fire, he and everyone else responsible got sacked.

They also laid off a ton of employees, cut marketing expenses, cut waste, etc:

https://preview.redd.it/z7p2prls0p0f1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c6f5211988fe715b00d5c4fa391fb2efdd6e67

Now you might notice they're still losing money per every house they buy. Part of that is because they spend $14k on marketing per house they buy, which they'll hopefully fix by working with real estate agents instead of advertising straight to consumers. We'll get into the other reasons.

**Opendoor learns prices go up in the Summer**

Housing has an annual cycle. Prices go up in the Summer, and down in the Winter:

https://preview.redd.it/f824gu1tyo0f1.png?width=1994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b90a8cbd312c38e374aaf42eb8f4c4d355c5ab6

Traditionally, Opendoor has been buying most of its homes in the Summer, because more people come to them to sell, so, why not:

https://preview.redd.it/63soyzu0zo0f1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac7fe4b5184f2baedb195d701de3b9f66008d23

Anyways, buying in the Summer is dumb because prices go down in the Fall. Not only that, but they take longer to sell which means more holding costs. Thankfully Opendoor finally figured that out this year, and promised to cut it out and buy more houses in the Winter and Spring instead. Expect more profit.

**Housing Market to improve, probably**

Back in 2020-2022, the housing market looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/me4gb8kpzo0f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5091617ca516a8b4971af09502f87b767a0f849

And Opendoor ***made over a billion dollars*** in home-flipping profit, although important things like marketing, interest, and director salaries managed to eat up most of that:

https://preview.redd.it/c9nuqftuzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fde5b351930e96c054192e5133932ac6feb232

Then interest rates did this:

https://preview.redd.it/uxmvhl9yzo0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b73632fed215ad8d78c53c879446244b68bd456e

And nobody could buy a home anymore:

https://preview.redd.it/7hvy9r610p0f1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=a267029f52539e541af25bf4098d037ae6c84341

Home prices have been dropping:

https://preview.redd.it/hsm06i540p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5931c24ce3109d4ce9189094b014e2a68038921a

Which means Opendoor is paying millions in interest to keep $2B in homes on the balance sheet that are *depreciating*:

https://preview.redd.it/jy54y2p60p0f1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a36afec855753ace87e778f110b0d090c983ca

And the homes now take months to sell. Long holding times require maintenance and interest, which now eat half of profits:

https://preview.redd.it/wmn0sedc0p0f1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=56f664218157888a2d9e3d2a1af9407a27ad2e78

Fortunately, Trump says he's going to bully Jerome Powell into making 2-3 rate cuts this year so the US can refinance its debt, and that will hopefully maybe unfreeze the housing market. This will be huge for Opendoor. All the tailwinds we've discussed will start going in reverse: more acquisitions, home price appreciation, shorting holding times and lower interest costs. In short, more money.

**Opendoor to actually make money in Q2**

Q2‚Äôs estimates is for Ebitda profitability of $5-$20M, the first time Opendoor will make a quarterly profit in three years. 2025's housing market is even worse than previous years, so this means the business itself is becoming more profitable. Losses are still expected for Q3 and Q4, but they're expected to be smaller than previous years.

**Path to Profitability**

Opendoor lost $392M last year. Here‚Äôs how we get to adjusted net income positive:

* $80M: Opendoor laid off 300 workers in Q4, which saves $20M a quarter.
* $75M: My spreadsheet says Opendoor loses $12k per house they buy in Summer and Fall. They said they're going to stop doing this so that's $75M.
* $55M: They spend $4k per house more on interest and holding costs than they did in 2021. That's gonna be fixed because the housing market will improve and they'll stop buying homes in the Summer.
* $80M: Opendoor is starting to send customers that don't take their offers to real estate agents, which pay a referral fee. 1% referral fee \* 2% of 1.2M customers \* $330k average house price = $80M
* $130M: Housing appreciation. Opendoor has $2.2B in houses that have been depreciating at 1% a year. Should housing return to a historically normal 5% rate of appreciation, that‚Äôs $130M in profit.

That‚Äôs already $420M in savings, enough to be profitable. Revenue should also grow higher as the housing market unfreezes, and marketing spend should be more effective as they learn to partner with real estate agents.

**Debt Refinanced, cash to scale through next two years**

On May 9 Opendoor announced it had exchanged $245M in existing convertible bonds due in March for new convertible bonds due in 2030 at 7% rate, convertible at $1.57. Opendoor also issued $75M in new bonds, raising $75 in new capital. $135M in bonds is still due in 2026, but this will be easily payable with cash on hand.

Following the equity raise and bond refinance, Opendoor has $1.1 billion in capital of which 768M is cash (693M from Q1 report plus $75M equity they just raised). On the Q4 and Q1 transcripts management stated they had refinanced 90% of their credit lines through 2026.

Management has reassured us that they still have available cash and personnel to return to a much larger scale of operations. In the Q1 report they stated that only $350M of their cash is invested in homes, and they have $559M (probably $634M now) available to deploy towards home purchases. They are also only using $2B of their existing $8B credit line. From these numbers it seems they have the financing to purchase 3x more homes than they currently are. Management has guided that they are capable of purchasing many more homes, but they are choosing to purchase less while the housing market is slow and margins are low. I expect them to deploy this capital and scale in Q4, assuming mortgage rates start to fall.¬†

**Growing Short Interest**

This isn‚Äôt the first time the bears have shorted Opendoor, only to buy back their shorts at a loss when it turns out Opendoor isn‚Äôt dead after all:

The setup today is the same as it was in Dec 2022: the housing market is weak and everyone assumes Opendoor is dead, but it actually has years ahead of it and many tailwinds coming.

Chart from last month:

https://preview.redd.it/maq7tv7c1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=94560ccb30622d867dc6d39550747fdf46d7461b

From Nasdaq short interest we can see a net short position of 20M was added in the month of April:

https://preview.redd.it/sn7bk9mf1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=398ffff8aefed808010665a8ba234eb4211436a1

The price jump on April 7 was due to a good quarterly report, where the company projected it would be Ebitda positive in Q2 for the first time in three years. Two days later it fell on the news of the debt refinancing. Presumably the terms of the debt refinancing scared some investors: 7% bonds¬† convertible at $1.57, is expensive, and issuing them now when the stock price is so low might seem to some as desperate. On the other hand, this eliminates $245M in bond payments for next year and raised $75M in new capital. I view it as a positive development, as it extends Opendoor's runway and frees them to scale up purchases this winter. Without this debt raise, they wouldn't be able to fully deploy their capital in Q4 and Q1, since their cash would be invested in homes due to sell in Q2, and $400M was due in March.¬†

**Hedge Fund Russell 2000 arbitrage?**

Look at this chart again:

https://preview.redd.it/0id2wu3j1p0f1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71de966368d3226cbb52398985c028d128fce8b

Note on April 23 Opendoor briefly rose above $1, then got shorted very hard in a coordinated action. There was a negative housing report that came out a few days earlier, but no news specific to April 23 and 24. Russel climbed 3.5% during this period and other real estate stocks climbed, but Opendoor fell 30% for seemingly no reason.¬†

One theory is this was an arbitrage move by hedge funds to kick Opendoor out of the Russell 2000. Ranking day was April 29, so any stock below $1 on April 29 will be removed on June 27. About 20M shares are held by iShares Russel 2000 ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/orb64bxl1p0f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9b3acb1fb0f4b565590f03e77894d0cd2daf3e

20M net shorts were added in April, and 20M shares will be sold near the end of day on June 27 by iShares ETFs when the Russell 2000 is adjusted. Probably the shorts will cover on that day to make a nice profit. As a long-term investor, this is reason to believe Opendoor's current price is disconnected from its recent performance, since all the recent news coming out of the business has been positive. Given the stock's history in the last several years of wild swings, I wouldn't be surprised if it shot back up to the $2-$3 range after the shorts cover in June.

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid company that made over a billion dollars of home-flipping profit in 2021 when the housing market was good. Then their CEO lit a billion dollars on fire buying overpriced houses. He was fired and replaced with a responsible CFO. They've been learning important lessons: realtors exist for a reason, and house prices go up in the Summer. Now that they know these things they can make money. When Jerome Powell fixes the housing market they'll make even more money, and the stock will pull a Carvana and go up 100x.

Also, Opendoor just refinanced its debt so its very much not dead, they have over a billion dollars still, enough for at least two years, more if they fix their business as planned, or if the Fed fixes it for them.

Also, last month's price action was probably just the hedge funds shorting Opendoor to kick it out of Russell 2000 and abuse the poor etfs that will have to sell at a low price. I'm hoping the stock triples after the shorts close, probably on June 27.",1747214237.0

1klvvwe,Celsius ($CELH): Still Time to Buy the Dip,69,75,"**Overview:**

Celsius is an energy drink company founded in 2004, headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. Over the past few years, they have emerged as one of the top players in the global energy drink market, competing with companies like Red Bull, Monster, Kuerig Dr. Pepper, and more. They offer products that are designed to provide energy and boost metabolism, without the addition of harmful artificial ingredients that many traditional energy drinks contain. This focus on health and wellness gives them strong brand recognition within the niche market of fitness, and individuals who live active lifestyles. Consumer preferences have been continuously shifting to health-conscious alternatives, which is why Celsius has been performing greatly, and will continue to.

**The Dip Explained:**

The company has gone through a significant dip in share price, going from $95.15 in May of 2024, to $22.34 in February of 2025. However, since then the company has been making a swift come back and is now trading at $37.36. This recovery came on the news of the Alani Nu acquisition in March of 2025. Now, what made the stock dip so heavily in the first place? For this, it is important to understand the relationship between Celsius and PepsiCo. While they do compete in the same market, given that PepsiCo owns energy drinks like Rockstar, Bang Energy, and MTN Dew Energy, they are also great partners. In August of 2022, PepsiCo invested $550 million into Celsius, giving them 8.5% ownership of the company. This strategic alliance allowed Celsius access to PepsiCo‚Äôs distribution network, leading to surges in sales due to increased availability. Celsius quickly became a brand name with a presence in gyms, college campuses, and international chains like Walmart, Costco, Target, and other stores like 7-Eleven. Throughout the span of their relationship, Celsius has seen strongly increasing revenue thanks to PepsiCo, who was responsible for 54.7% of Celsius sales in 2024. Celsius‚Äôs next largest customer was Costco which made up around 10%.

So, as we can see, Celsius has a dependency on PepsiCo which is the main driving force behind their growth. In early 2024, PepsiCo distributors had built up excess inventory of Celsius, leading them to cut back on orders because of overstocking. This resulted in a strong halt in Celsius growth, killing all momentum and hype that the stock had. Celsius was a very hot stock at this time and definitely overvalued which is why news of that magnitude had such a drastic impact.¬†Analysts of the stock from companies like BoA and Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, leading to further decline in the price.

It is very important to note that this does not mean Celsius was not growing. Their retail sales, (the sales they make to every day consumers like you and me) continued to grow, with a 22% YoY growth.

I see Celsius as a fantastic company, that was simply trading too high for the valuation at the time. The hype train got crushed, everyone jumped off, price plummeted, and now we are seeing positive things for the company once again.

**Financials:**

Overall, the financials of this company over the last 5 years are very healthy. Let‚Äôs get into them starting with a revenue breakdown which will show Revenue by Geography, and Revenue Growth by Region.¬†

[Sources: Cap IQ, Excel, PowerPoint](https://preview.redd.it/5p98ung0rl0f1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0952f779f10b703ed2887ba8c5abacd60073410c)

As you can see from the tables, Celsius depends heavily on North America for sales. That is where the majority of the energy drink demand comes from. While they are less prominent in international markets, they have still shown their ability to grow both in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Total revenue was growing at explosive rates over the 5-year time period, with 100+% growth in 3 straight years. While revenue still grew in 2024 at 2.9%, this figure represents the pullback in PepsiCo orders.¬†

Now let us look at some of their profitability ratios to better understand their financial performance. I am not going to go into detail on these, but they are all healthy and worth mentioning for anyone who is curious.

**Celsius has a TTM P/E ratio of 114.89, with a FWD P/E ratio of 42.81. Their TTM P/B ratio is 19.82, and their FWD P/B ratio is 7.76. The company is essentially debt free with a total debt/equity of 1.55%.**

**Acquisitions:**

Celsius is a company focused on fostering organic growth, but also continuously looking for ways to expand inorganically. In 2024, they acquired Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing for $75 million in cash, which gives them control over a 175,000 sqft manufacturing facility in Charolette, North Carolina. This company had been a packing partner for Celsius for years, but Celsius stated the focus of the acquisition was to gain greater control over their supply chain. This will lead to quicker product innovation cycles, and improved margins and profitability through per-case savings and better leverage. The management team and workforce of Big Beverage are remaining with the operation.

Then, in April of 2025, Celsius announced plans to acquire fellow energy brand, Alani Nu for $1.8 billion. $1.275 billion was paid in cash and $500 million issued in common stock. Alani Nu is a rapidly growing brand that operates within a niche market. 92% of the brands digital followers are women, with 49% of them being repeat consumers. They are most popular amongst Gen Z and millennial consumers. In 2024, they had sales of $550 million displaying strong demand.¬†

**Celsius Q1 2025 Earnings:**

The company reported earnings for Q1 of 2025 on May 6th, narrowly missing EPS and revenue expectations. Revenue saw a 7% decline of $329.3 million for the quarter, compared to $355.7 million from 2024 Q1. However, international revenue increased by $22.8 million for Q1, representing a 41% increase compared to 2024 Q1. and 9% international revenue growth YoY.

Retail sales decreased 3% YoY for Celsius. Despite this, retail sales for Alani Nu increased 88% year over year.

**Conclusion:**

Celsius is a very good brand with strong market positioning. Due to their approach to clean and healthy energy alternatives, they are incredibly well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the changing consumer preferences within the market. I believe the hiccup with PepsiCo is a great buying opportunity, as it killed the momentum of a fantastic long-term stock. **The company continues to expand, with acquisitions like we discussed, and with sales commencing in Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, and New Zealand in 2024. Celsius has not seen the full benefit yet of PepsiCo‚Äôs wide distribution network, and in the following years, I believe they will become a popular global brand outside of the United States. The company has a very good management team, with a clear and outlined strategy for growth and sustainability over the years. This all gives me tremendous confidence in the stock.** **I believe that Celsius Holdings, Inc. is a great company, and therefore a great buy at $37.83 per share.**

(Bloomberg) -- Hertz Global Holdings Inc. shares plunged after the car-rental company posted a larger-than-expected loss in the first quarter, pressured by a slowdown in customer bookings.

Revenue fell 13% in the period, contributing to an adjusted loss of $1.12 per share, the company said in a statement late Monday. Analysts had expected a 99-cent deficit on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

The company showed declines on multiple key metrics. While forward bookings from leisure customers were up from a year ago, demand from corporate and government customers has moderated.

Hertz moved to sell older models and buy newer cars before President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs raised their prices. About 70% of the company‚Äôs fleet is less than a year old, which should drive down future depreciation costs, Chief Executive Officer Gil West said Tuesday on the company‚Äôs investor call.

‚ÄúWe have a younger fleet that‚Äôs well equipped to navigate today‚Äôs uncertainty,‚Äù West said. He added the company worked closely with automakers in the first quarter to accept vehicle deliveries ‚Äúahead of schedule to avoid tariff exposure.‚Äù

West said the timing of Hertz‚Äôs fleet moves meant the company lost some business in certain markets and he acknowledged that the company faces economic uncertainty.

While Hertz is ‚Äúaccelerating its transition strategy and has some benefits on depreciation, we believe the risk ahead is on demand,‚Äù Barclays analyst Dan Levy wrote in a research report. He noted that the first-quarter miss was primarily in the Americas.

Hertz shares fell 17% at 1:48 p.m. Tuesday in New York. The stock had gained 90% this year through Monday‚Äôs close.

Hertz is offering fewer cars for rent as it freshens its fleet and contends with the trade war that has rattled markets and consumer sentiment. Bill Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Capital Management has amassed a nearly 20% stake in the rental car company, in a part as a bet that tariffs will drive up the value of Hertz‚Äôs fleet. Ackman has said that he thinks the worst is behind Hertz, though he expects near-term results will be weak.

Ackman‚Äôs stake lost $71 million during intraday trading at 1:45 p.m. in New York. His $352 million position is still up about $4 million from April 16, the day before he disclosed his position in an X post.

Hertz said on the earnings call that it expects to break even on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the second quarter and achieve positive net income in the third quarter of this year. Its first-quarter adjusted Ebitda loss was $325 million, worse than analysts expected.

One culprit for missing estimates was a shortfall in revenue, which was $1.8 billion, while analysts expected $2 billion. The company‚Äôs vehicle utilization rate climbed to 79%, up 3 percentage points from a year ago, but still historically weak. Revenue per day also fell 5% to $53.38. That was partly caused by having too many vehicles in some markets, Hertz Chief Commercial Officer Sandeep Dube told analysts on the call.

‚ÄúAll told, we didn‚Äôt get the utility out of these additional vehicles that we normally would have and probably left some price on the table,‚Äù Dube said.

Hertz said it‚Äôs on track to reduce depreciation on its cars to less than $300 per month per vehicle in the second quarter, earlier than expected.

This was the first quarter in which Hertz is no longer unloading electric vehicles, which renters shunned and resulted in high repair costs. The strategy misstep led to $2.9 billion in losses last year. Hertz earlier this year said it achieved its goal of selling off 30,000 battery-powered cars.",1747163144.0

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is weighing a deal that would allow the UAE to import more than a million advanced Nvidia chips, a quantity that far exceeds limits under Biden-era AI chip regulations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.

The deal, which is still being negotiated and could change, would let the UAE import 500,000 of the most advanced chips on the market each year from now to 2027, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

While one-fifth would be set aside for the Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, the rest will go to U.S. companies building data centers in the Gulf nation, according to the report.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which may announce new data-center capacity in the UAE as soon as this week, could be one of those companies, the report said.

The report comes on the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump securing a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States.

The Department of Commerce and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment.

Abu Dhabi's artificial intelligence push has mostly been led by state-backed G42, which has drawn increased scrutiny from China hawks in Washington amid fears that the UAE is becoming a conduit for China to receive advanced American AI technology it is blocked from getting directly from the U.S.

According to the Bloomberg report, G42 could purchase computing capabilities equivalent to between 1 million and 1.5 million H100 chips over the lifetime of the deal. That is around four times more than it would have been allowed to buy under a Biden-era chip export control framework, known as AI diffusion, it said.

Trump's administration plans to rescind and modify this rule, which curbed the export of sophisticated AI chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce had said last week.",1747162266.0

Bearish
- March PPI was mainly before tariffs went into effect or companies bought ahead that they didn‚Äôt buy as much in March, but they had to in April
- Market is coming in hot after big gains since last Thur so any PPI surprise that indicates CPI may increase in May could give reason for people to take profits

Bullish
- PPI decreased 0.4% in March and expected to increase 0.2% in April
- Tariff impact so far isolated to certain industries, so it won‚Äôt have a big impact in total even if more industries are hit
- Even if there is a high surprise, people will shrug it off since there seems to be consensus (euphoria?) all this will get sorted out soon given China announcement

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group on Tuesday suspended its annual forecast citing higher-than-expected medical costs and said CEO Andrew Witty has decided to step down for personal reasons, effective immediately, sending its shares down 8% premarket.

Stephen Hemsley, who served as CEO from 2006-2017, will take over from Witty.

The U.S. health insurance industry has been grappling with increased costs since mid-2023 due to a surge in demand for healthcare services under government-backed Medicare plans for older adults or individuals with disabilities.

In April, UnitedHealth posted its first earnings miss since 2008 and a bleak forecast.

The company expects to return to growth in 2026, it said on Tuesday.

1kle82u,China removes Boeing delivery ban,390,68,"China has removed a month-long ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing Co. planes, according to people familiar with the matter, following a breakthrough in trade talks with the US that temporarily slashed tariffs on each side.

Officials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of US-made aircraft can resume, the people said, asking not to identified because the information is confidential. Discretion has been given for airlines to organize delivery on their own timing and terms, one of the people added. 

The resumption of deliveries to China will be an immediate boost to the Boeing. 

The thawing comes as the world‚Äôs two biggest economies agreed to a tariff truce, with the US lowering its combined 145% levies on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. China agreed to slash its 125% duties on US goods to 10%, and remove other countermeasures taken against the US since April 2. Still, the restoration of jet deliveries could be short-lived if the tariff war isn‚Äôt resolved during the three-month reprieve. 

Boeing had found itself caught in the middle of the trade spat after President Donald Trump‚Äôs unveiling of tariffs on most major trading partners was met with retaliatory duties from China. That priced Boeing jets out of the market for Chinese carriers, while Beijing ordered airlines to stop taking deliveries of the company‚Äôs aircraft. 

Signs of a potential detente emerged in late April, when China said it was willing to support normal cooperation with US companies. Beijing had offered to suspend higher duties on some US imports, including medical equipment, some industrial chemicals and plane leases.",1747114427.0

(Reuters) -Amazon has hired FedEx to handle some of its large package deliveries, the companies said on Monday, weeks after UPS said it was halting its less-profitable deliveries for the e-commerce retailer and cutting 20,000 jobs.

FedEx shares surged on Monday even more than rallying Wall Street benchmarks, finishing up 7%. The Memphis-based delivery company said the multi-year agreement covers residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.

The deal with FedEx, signed in February, gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared with delivery rival UPS, Business Insider had reported, citing an internal document.

The agreement will not replace UPS, Amazon said as FedEx will join its third-party partners, including UPS and the USPS, and work alongside its own last-mile delivery network.

FedEx called it a ""mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement"" in a statement.

The deal may signal a thaw in relations between FedEx and Amazon. The companies cut residential delivery ties in 2019 as Amazon was building its now sprawling network of delivery services.

UPS said in January it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon, its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries.

Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in Amazon deliveries, as well as cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring.

FedEx and UPS have been in a fierce battle for market share over the last five years, often poaching whole or partial customer accounts from the other.",1747096250.0

His plan? **The Secretary of HHS is going to figure out how patients can ‚Äúbuy their drugs directly from manufacturers,‚Äù cutting out the middlemen entirely.**

So if Trump actually follows through on this and cuts out the middlemen, what happens to Cigna‚Äôs PBM revenue, which makes up 80% of their income? Does it just disappear? üìâ

Over the last few weeks‚Ä¶ bruh... Google has been¬†**DRAGON DANCING**. Sacrificing short-term gains to buff its¬†*long-term attack and movement speed stats*.

Like my analysis on hims, Charizard earlier was doing premature flamethrowers, unable to impress the other step-dragons because of it's lack of fore, I mean preparation. That‚Äôs right. Not consolidating. Not pulling back. **CHARGING. ITS. STATS.**  
  
This is shown by the wiggles downward from the 1W candles. But this isn‚Äôt weakness ‚Äî it‚Äôs¬†a *setup*. Because of this, Google stock will do 1.5X the gains and 1.5X movement after casting DRAGON DANCE TWICE for a total of 3x gains, 3x speed in total.

At $157, the chart shows¬†**resistance forming a textbook Metapod Cluster Formation**¬†‚Äî known for attempting to¬†**Harden**¬†and slow bullish momentum.

BUT‚Ä¶

**CHARIZARD HAS FULLY FORMED ON THE CHART.** **FULLY FKING ERECT.**  
  
That means Google stock will use FLAMETHROWER at the $157 resistance along with the 3X speed and damage from Dragon Dance to burn that past the bearish METAPODS who try hardening at that price.

For this very reason, I bought $100k in Google 2026 Calls. Fire-breathing dragon with 3x buffs isn't just Bullish like a Taurus or Bearish like an Usurang‚Äî it‚Äôs LITERALLY A LEVEL 100 DRAGON THAT WILL 1 SHOT ANYTHING IN ITS WAY, so DRAGONISH.

President¬†Donald Trump¬†announced Sunday that he plans to resurrect a controversial policy from his first term that aims to reduce drug costs by basing payments for certain medicines on their prices in other countries.

His prior rule, called ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation,‚Äù was finalized in late 2020 but blocked by federal courts and rescinded by then-President Joe Biden in 2021. It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors‚Äô offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.

In a¬†Truth Social post¬†Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.

‚ÄúI will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country‚Äôs history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION‚ÄôS POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.‚Äù

The directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose¬†tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president‚Äôs first term. The¬†tariffs¬†could¬†exacerbate shortages¬†of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.

If the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients‚Äô access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.

Although lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told¬†Politico¬†last year that he had moved away from the ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.

But the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP‚Äôs sweeping¬†tax and spending cuts package. However, it‚Äôs unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.

The initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.

The Trump administration¬†introduced¬†the idea of tying Medicare‚Äôs drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and¬†finalized the rule¬†just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.

Under the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors‚Äô offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.

At the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats‚Äô Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the¬†historic power¬†to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.

A ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù proposal could save beneficiaries‚Äô money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said.",1747003403.0

1kkd0t1,25-20% or lower China tarrif announcement on Monday? IMO high chance.,5,184,"It could be a huge rally tomorrow if what I think turns out to be right. The embargo level tarrif of 145% currently in place re China will cause a recession if not immediately lowered. Since lowering it to 80% (like Trump suggested via Truth a few days ago) or even 50% is still embargo level, it make sense that there is a high chance its way lower than the market expects, think 25-20% or lower! This would also make it easy for the Chinese to accept the deal, since they wont lose face (they want 0% after all). If the Chinese accepted 50%, its still embargo level, and they might think thats not saving face. I.e. the necessity of having to reduce the tarrif to a non embargo level plus China wanting to save face, means that it might be near 25-20% or lower, which would come as a positive shock to the market (think 5% rally on the S&P).

Announcing a nothing burger like some think is unlikely, as there is enormous pressure to lower the tarrif immediately to lift the embargo. Otherwise shortages and a recession awaits.",1747002061.0

# Inflation, Retail Sales Reports Come As Investors Watch Data Amid Tariff Developments

The weekend meetings on trade between U.S. and Chinese officials are likely to capture market watchers‚Äô attention to start the week, with investors hopeful that trade tensions between the two nations could be easing.

Inflation will be in focus as investors get their first look at April prices with the Tuesday release of the¬†[Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). At last week‚Äôs Federal Reserve meeting, officials said they were looking for more improvement on inflation before moving to lower interest rates from their current levels.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Thursday; last week, President Trump was critical of the Fed for failing to act on interest rates.¬†Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller, and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are among the other officials expected to deliver remarks this week.

March‚Äôs CPI report indicated that inflation¬†[dropped unexpectedly to a rise of 2.4%](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-unexpectedly-fell-in-march-amid-tariff-turmoil-11712611),¬†while other recent indicators have¬†[shown that price increases are slowing](https://www.investopedia.com/inflation-was-flat-in-march-pce-measure-shows-11724760). Investors are also expecting updates on import and export prices, as well as April‚Äôs Producer Price Index, which shows inflation at the wholesale level.

Retail sales data, scheduled for Thursday, comes as consumer spending has been strong while shoppers¬†[rush to buy items](https://www.investopedia.com/will-consumer-fears-show-up-in-the-march-retail-sales-report-11714988)¬†before tariffs take hold. Economists are looking for signs of change in spending levels, with recent consumer sentiment surveys showing that feelings about the economy are worsening.

On Friday, the latest sentiment report is expected to offer May's first look at how consumers feel about current and future economic conditions. The survey offers insights into spending patterns that can help support the economy. It follows several months of¬†[surveys showing declining consumer sentiment](https://www.investopedia.com/falling-consumer-confidence-has-set-off-this-recession-alarm-11724208)¬†amid worries over the administration's tariffs' impact on prices. Tuesday‚Äôs expected small business sentiment report could further signal the economy‚Äôs direction.

The homebuilders' confidence survey, scheduled for Thursday, and Friday‚Äôs expected housing starts data, will highlight inventory supply trends during a period in which housing scarcity is helping¬†[drive affordability problems](https://www.investopedia.com/want-a-view-of-the-housing-affordability-crisis-these-numbers-show-the-trend-11688451).

Investors will also be looking at Thursday‚Äôs scheduled industrial productivity report for data on the manufacturing sector. Monday‚Äôs planned release of the monthly federal budget for April will provide an update on government debt levels.

# Walmart Earnings Come as Investors Watch for Consumer Spending Trends

Walmart‚Äôs scheduled quarterly report on Thursday leads the weekly earnings calendar, as market watchers seek information on consumer spending and economic conditions amid¬†[uncertain U.S. trade policy](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-costco-likely-to-fare-well-under-tariffs-ubs-says-11708483).

The retail giant reported prior-quarter earnings per share and revenue that came in ahead of analyst expectations, but its¬†[outlook was weaker than expected](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-earnings-q4-fy25-11681695)¬†as the company said it was evaluating the impact of tariffs on its business.

Still feel more upside to resolving tariffs than downside (at least progress) money on sidelines really want to push market up.

I like BTC related trade right now because if things do go poorly with tariffs, it‚Äôs actually a bit less downward volatile compared to something like QQQ. In fact, it could slowly shift to becoming a ‚Äúsafety‚Äù trade to preserve capital. 

Years ago I would have felt BTC would be a flight to safety like Gold or Swiss Franc. But it actually is positively correlated and even a bit less volatile lately. So I look at BTC more after hours than after hours pricing.

For instance, just had a small jump up when China talks said they‚Äôd resume Sunday. (And didn‚Äôt blow up). Trading solidly above $100k and may break $105k this week given the momentum.

I don‚Äôt own BTC but MSTR is a proxy. Even HOOD is a proxy since crypto trades are so profitable. But BTC is still a good indicator for overall market. At least I tell myself that on a weekend :)

One last note‚Ä¶ people don‚Äôt understand MSTr earnings. They are basically based on BTC profits. Q1 saw a drop so major negative earnings. But by April, already shifted positive. So Q2 will be massive profitability. It‚Äôs expected given BTC above $100k but again, many people don‚Äôt get that and will see huge beat. I‚Äôll probably exit MSTR early June in any bit up day. Re-enter on any pull back to roll forward to catch q2 earnings.

The CEO Alan baratz has a history of success as he rolled out JAVA script to fortune 500.

Modern computing r&d died with the transistor. Moore's law depended on the capabilities in lithography to keep getting better creating smaller and smaller transistors. Now they have reached 1--3 nm which is a physical constraint for the required silicon atom bond angles. Surface energy this skyrockets causing poor performance and heat generation to failure. Because of the all computing r&d needs to move to qubits. AI has gotten ahead of its processing capacity and that means huge money flows compared to market caps in quantum company's.

After earnings, HIMS popped, stalled, then ripped again. In the middle of that, Robinhood quietly reclassified the results from a beat to a miss with no explanation. The actual EPS didn‚Äôt change, but the prediction did...that was bizaare to say the least. That move likely shook out some momentum traders, but it also probably incentivized those with shorts to cover their position and the core of the trade played out exactly as laid out.

**What We Got Right:**

* **GLP-1 rollout timing:** Management confirmed GLP-1 expansion is coming in the second half of the year. That was the central thesis. It hit.
* **Narrative gap:** The street was still pricing HIMS like a gimmick. Fundamentals were stronger than sentiment reflected and that dislocation created the edge.
* **Novo Nordisk partnership:** The market hadn‚Äôt priced in a legitimate relationship with Novo Nordisk. That‚Äôs a signal of operational credibility. It changes the long-term risk profile.
* **Delayed continuation:** Price action didn‚Äôt fully react until the day after earnings and things were looking weird overnight. That delay reinforced the view that this was a misunderstood setup, not a crowded one.

**What We Missed:**

* **Compounding uncertainty:** We didn‚Äôt fully account for how regulatory headlines around compounded GLP-1s might weigh on sentiment. That was a risk that deserved more weight.
* **Robinhood‚Äôs walk-back:** A last-minute classification change from a major platform like Robinhood shouldn‚Äôt matter, but I think it did. Not sure if other platforms retroactively changed their EPS predictions.  Several people reached out to me concerned that it had missed, only to realize minutes later that it didn't.  Some institutions were predicting EPS at .23, including Robinhood, but the .14 predicted EPS that they reverted to and was held by many other institutions won the day, making this a beat.

**This Was Not a Gamble**

There was risk, but this was never YOLO. This was a structured asymmetric trade with a defined catalyst window, options mispricing, and a clear narrative pivot. That‚Äôs the whole game.

The market is still digesting what HIMS is becoming. We were ahead of that. And we‚Äôll be ready again when the next setup hits.  If you've made it this far, I'm sure you're wondering why my balance is $29.74...I'm switching to Thinkorswim.  Robinhood is a smooth platform to use, but I think TOS is going to be better for me in trying to line up trades like this.  Thanks for reading.",1746865870.0

1kithya,300x SPY Bear Call Spread into the Trade Deal Hopium ‚Äî Charging $3.25. Free Money?,194,122,"SPY‚Äôs been ripping lately from its lows on ‚Äútrade deals‚Äù and general hopium. Latest one? UK. media made it seem like a big deal, but that‚Äôs not moving markets. Plus, that's an ally. Easier to get a trade deal done there than with other trading partners.

China is the main one that matters. And I don't think we‚Äôre anywhere close.

Markets have been pumping on this weekend's meeting with China, and this is how I think the news will go on Monday: Trump says, ‚ÄúThe deal went great.‚Äù ‚Äî Xi comes out a day later and says, ‚ÄúWe're not even close.‚Äù  

All in all, the leading player who's been flinching and going back on their word is the orange man and his crew. XI's been set in stone, while Trump's flinching with either bond yields rising, markets collapsing, negative remarks from big Wall Street players, etc, etc..

Most Recent Trump talks tough (145% tariffs), then backs off (80%), then says they‚Äôre negotiating (BTW 145% and 80% is the same thing in terms of trade - people are importing anything with either). This cycle‚Äôs been repeating. Xi isn‚Äôt blinking. We are.

So here‚Äôs what I did:

* **Sold 300 SPY 605C 9/30/25 @ 10.74**
* **Bought 300 SPY 615C 9/30/25 @ 7.49**

Total credit: **$3.25 or $97,500**

SPY‚Äôs at **564**

Break-even at **608.25** ‚Üí That‚Äôs a **7.8% move up**

Max loss if SPY rips above **615 around a 9% move up**

# Thesis:

* Trade deal with China breaks down (again) next week
* No way we rally another 8‚Äì10% with macro headwinds
* Market already priced in ‚Äúgood outcome,‚Äù there‚Äôs too much downside from here
* We don‚Äôt touch February‚Äôs high again anytime soon

**Risk:**

* CPI tanks ‚Üí Fed starts signaling cuts
* Tech earnings beat hard
* Or Xi caves (not likely)

If we go higher and break SPY ATH, im cooked. But I like the odds. Ill take a 2 to 1 risk reqard any day of the week.

**TL;DR**

Charged $3.25 for 300x bear call spread.

SPY needs to break ATH for me to get burnt. Way to many hurdles in its path, main one being a China deal.

If we chop or fade on another China fake-out, I‚Äôm walking with 6 figures.

The lesson is when the trade starts losing and you gave it a month or two, get out if you have options. I was trading those 2026 call options in the 3 range and now they're worth 0.1 to 0.2. I got out when they were down 60% so could have been far worse.

I now just day trade stocks and hope to slowly make it all back by the end of the year.

P.S. I am the guy who had CORZZ Core Scientific penny warrants from 1, with 70k worth when it was 3, and panic sold at low 2 last April 2024...they then went to 10+ by summer and 18 by the fall and I had expected a potential move to 10 by fall, but had weak hands since sold in the 2s.

Never give up, you can always make it back, but stay away from call options on foreign companies because they tend to be pump and dumps (Iren IRIS Energy being an example). Even if you are right about the general direction of the market you will still get rekt if you pick the wrong thing.

Always look for other opportunities and remember you can make it all back in one trade!

I'm targeting spreads on Affirm (AFRM) centered around the $52 strike for options expiring on May 9. My thesis is based on a few key factors:

Pre-Earnings Run-Up: AFRM has seen a notable run-up ahead of earnings, which often signals a ""buy the rumor"" dynamic. Historically, the stock tends to pull back slightly after earnings‚Äîregardless of the results‚Äîwhich supports a cautious short-term outlook.

Earnings Expectations: While I do expect Affirm to report solid earnings, the recent rally appears to have already priced in a lot of optimism. This sets the stage for a potential ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù reaction.

Strike Selection and Price Target: I'm placing spreads around the $52 level, which I estimate to be a reasonable pullback zone post-earnings. It represents a balance between the current elevated price and historical reaction patterns.

Option Pricing and Volatility: The implied volatility (rather than delta‚Äîthough both are relevant) is extremely high going into earnings, inflating premiums. This benefits the spread structure I‚Äôm using. The options for the May 9 expiry are priced so attractively that, even if the stock moves ¬±10%, the spread could still return a profit due to favorable pricing and volatility crush post-earnings.

1. **Strong Revenue Growth** 
   - MNDY has a **3-year revenue CAGR of 35.3%showing consistent expansion.  
   - The company serves **225,000+ customers across 200 countries**

2. **High Gross Margins & Free Cash Flow**
   - **Gross profit margin of 89.33%** 
   - **Free cash flow margin of 28%** supporting reinvestment and expansion.  

3. **Enterprise Adoption & Market Expansion** 
   - MNDY is gaining traction among **large enterprises**, expanding beyond SMBs.  
The **total addressable market (TAM) is projected to reach $150 billion by 2026**.  

4. **Profitability Improvements** 
   - MNDY turned profitable in **Q2 2024**, reporting a **net income margin of 6%**.  
**EPS growth projected at 30% CAGR over the next four years**.  

**Bear Case**
1. **High Valuation Premium**
   - **P/E ratio of 442.88**‚Äîsignificantly above industry averages.  
   - **DCF analysis suggests a fair value of $82.34 vs. current price of $265.73**

2. **Slowing Growth Rates** 
   - **Estimated revenue growth of 27.06%** is lower than its **3-year average of 46.61%**.  
  **EPS growth estimate of 15.20%** is below its **historical 38.40% CAGR**.  

3. **Competitive Pressure** 
   - Faces competition from **Asana (ASAN), Salesforce (CRM), and Smartsheet (SMAR)**.  
   Larger players could **outspend MNDY in R&D and marketing**, limiting its market share growth.  

4. **Macroeconomic Risks** 
   - If **interest rates remain high**, growth stocks like MNDY may struggle.  
   - **Tech sector volatility** could lead to sharp price corrections.  

### **Final Takeaway**  
MNDY has **strong growth potential**, but its **premium valuation** means it must **continue exceeding expectations**. If revenue growth slows or competition intensifies, its price could fall off a cliff. Although efficiency improvements, and earnings expansion could lead to a significant gain.

1khqc38,Why Uber is increasingly looking like a smart medium/long term pick,0,37,"Multiple things alligning in their favor:

1. Slow ride-hailing growth was a problem last quarter, but increasingly most businesses are moving to RTO mandate (including Uber, Google, most US government businesses, ...). This helps them fix the problem.
2. TESLA's smart taxis is proving to be a fud. Partnership with Waymo is expanding rapidly
3. Increasingly looks like they are going to acquire Instacart, and with that comes over 60% grocery market share, which is already profitable. Major leadership of Instacart is now from Uber (CTO, CFO), and Instacart's CEO just departed. Instacart's restaurant orders go to Uber, and Uber's ads come from Instacart. They are essentially complementary in all respects and solve each other's core business problem of growth. Almost seems like an acquisition is on the cards.
4. Uber's revenues fell in the last earnings, but profitability was way up. If they acquire Instacart, their revenues shoot up, plus they acquire a profitable business.
5. If they end up acquiring Instacart, they get a fleet that is heavily urban, and both can be cross-utilized that keeps costs down, and helps with the demand.

Really depends on what price they pay for Instacart.

1khmjtf,CVNA & ROOT Monster ER Beat?,3,17,"So Carvana & ROOT both reported yesterday with monster earnings.

  
CVNA reported 4.23B in revenue beating revenue estimates of 4B

and CVNA earnings was reported at 1.53 EPS versus .75 EPS, a near 104.66% beat.

  
On the surface earnings look incredible but with a closer look CVNA has reported 158M in NI from ROOT warrants. Thats 278 million collectively that CVNA has now recorded in ROOT warrant gains. The 373M net income was padded. though, regardless the earnings seem pretty solid.  

  
so my thought is, with ROOT's monster earnings announced yesterday with a 4000%+ beat in EPS and 42M+ rev beat, 80m QoQ growth in written premiums, the accounting of warrants by CVNA,  and the suspicious shelf offering announced in q1, it feels like CVNA may be gearing up to exercise those 180-216 warrants. if that is the case, shouldn't we see ROOT trade significantly higher than 216 soon? what do you guys think?",1746699398.0

My personal opinion is that google searches on Safari decreased because people default away from Safari. It‚Äôs a SAFARI problem, not a google search problem. Anyhow, of course, however, the pundits on CNBC and elsewhere are quick to come on and talk about Google‚Äôs impending end. And then, of course, like clockwork, a lot of people get on Reddit and give us their anecdotal experiences how search quality via Google has drastically fallen in their minds, and now they only use ChatGPT etc etc etc.

A couple of important points:

- In case you didn‚Äôt already know, Google gets 5 TRILLION search queries a year. That‚Äôs right, TRILLION. ChatGPT gets a fraction of that number. 
-75% of Google searches are NOT monetized by Google. In other words, Google monetizes much less searches than it can. That means there is ALWAYS an easy way to increase revenue annually for them.

- Your anecdotal experiences (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use Google anymore blah blah‚Äù is just that. I have heard for YEARS from people how ‚ÄúOh Netflix has terrible shows. I canceled my subscription; Amazon delivery speed is terrible, I canceled my Prime, etc. etc.‚Äù And People invest on their own personal experience. Guess what? Google‚Äôs financials are PUBLIC. Even though ChatGPT has been out since Nov 2022, Google search queries have INCREASED. YOU may now ONLY use ChatGPT but clearly, everyone else isn‚Äôt.

- The Paradox of Optionality: There are so many AI models coming out‚ÄîGROK, META, Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT‚Äîthat for the average lay person, optionality actually makes them paralyzed and likely to rely on what they know best: GOOGLE. 

- Google is the landing page. People go to google then go to ChatGPT‚Äôs site. people go to google first and type in Claude or Grok AI etc. Google is still the verb. Sure, ChatGPT has a place in the lexicon now, but when it comes to looking stuff up, GOOGLE is still the verb.

1kh9mix,"ARM Gives Tepid Forecast, Adding to Caution From Chipmakers",18,15,"Arm Holdings Plc gave a lackluster sales forecast for the current period, saying that the timing of new licensing agreements has made the chip company cautious about its predictions.

Revenue will be $1 billion to $1.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter, Arm said in a statement Wednesday. Wall Street had estimated a number at the highest end of that range.

Profit will be 30 to 38 cents a share, minus certain items, also lower than analysts' projections.
Arm shares fell more than 8% in extended trading following the announcement. The stock had been up less than 1% this year through the close.

The company is in the process of closing new licensing deals and wants to make sure they're signed before it adds the revenue to its outlook, according to Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas. Customers continue to push ahead with investment in chips, particularly for artificial intelligence computing, and that's benefiting Arm, he said.

This all probably doesn't mean anything and there's other reasons for these moves, but the people involved (CFO, COO, and Risk Policy Board Chair) and the fact that the CFO massively divested from his own company have me curious. ",1746647166.0
